<p>One of the tricky parts of LAScot was getting hold of the tokens for tracks 3 to 5, which were not filmed and required a token to get access. Or you could ‚Äúrisk‚Äù it and drop by anyway, maybe someone changes his/her mind or there is some room left. In all the workshops I‚Äôve been at, there were always extra people accommodated into the room.</p><p>These being said, on the first day I completely forgot about the tokens, although I was pretty early in the conference centre. Considering that I found also the workshops on the second day pretty interesting, I decided I will be early and grab tokens for a day of workshops. Said and done! üòä</p><h2 id="keynote_it‚Äôs_either_design_or_leanagile_transition_versus_the_test_drive_by_cameron_tonkinwise__camerontw" tabindex="-1">Keynote: <em>It‚Äôs either Design or LeanAgile: transition versus the test drive</em> by Cameron Tonkinwise (@ camerontw)</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#keynote_it‚Äôs_either_design_or_leanagile_transition_versus_the_test_drive_by_cameron_tonkinwise__camerontw"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to ‚ÄúKeynote: It‚Äôs either Design or LeanAgile: transition versus the test drive by Cameron Tonkinwise (@ camerontw)‚Äù</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8189.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8188-1024x558.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8185-1024x534.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8184-1024x604.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/agile?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#agile</a> = ‚ÄúPrecaution be damned!‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lascot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#lascot</a></p></blockquote><p>‚Äî Alex Chiri»õescu (@alexchiri) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/915862327735603200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2017</a></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>Lean & agile: a way to tell managers get lost</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8183-1024x534.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Let the people working directly to make decision</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8182-1024x588.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Agile & lean: a hardcore union</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8181-1024x539.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>‚Äúyou are spending your time lean-agile-ing crap!‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lascot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#lascot</a> <a href="https://t.co/BFmTNsN64P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BFmTNsN64P</a></p></blockquote><p>‚Äî Alex Chiri»õescu (@alexchiri) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/915865127299293190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2017</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8179-1024x533.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8176-1024x567.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>MVP-ing returns us to craft</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8175-1024x530.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8174-1024x560.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8173-1024x532.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>The corrosive cynicism of empiricism</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8172-1024x557.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>The drive to test things in the field is dangerous<p>Freud and The Death Drive: we are all kind of attracted to a type of death</p><p>We have a mania for testing things, even though it is painful and it destroys society</p><p>We begin to doubt of things we cannot test for ourselves, which causes mistrust in experts and in science</p></blockquote><p></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8171-1024x523.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Hawthorne effect: things start to improve just because you start testing<p>Mental models are discarded in empiricism of tests</p></blockquote><p></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8170-1024x523.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Millennials are trying to touch everything<p>Don‚Äôt talk about tests, talk about experiments</p></blockquote><p></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8167-1024x536.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>I‚Äôm being tested on Facebook without knowing and I‚Äôm not co-creating</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8166-1024x538.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8165-1024x529.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8164-1024x535.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8163-1024x534.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Haven‚Äôt enjoyed getting shouted at so much in a long time.

Afterwards, we received a case (you can download it from <a href="https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/ToC-TheTeamFromHell.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) that we should read and try to identify UDEs and intermediate effects.</p><p>From there, we attempted to build our own Current Reality Trees using post-its. I found this to be an interesting technique to determine root causes to different problems you have in an organisation. It needs some practice, as it gets pretty easy to get confused with which effects are intermediate or UDEs. But once mastered, I can imagine it is a very useful tool to understand problems or situations you encounter, which don‚Äôt have an obvious solution and can be more difficult to crack.</p><p>Bellow are the notes I made and some of my photos.

We started the workshop by writing on post-its different things we got positive feedback for and share them around the table. Next step was to write things we want to be recognised for. <strong>Did the 2 sets of notes overlap or was there a gap?</strong></p><p>In the next activity, we shared in groups of 2 our name, our role, what is our passion and we are doing about it. In the second round, one of us would make everything in his/her power not to listen to the other. Some even left the room or were speaking with other attendants. <strong>How did that affect the others who were trying to communicate with the ones avoiding communication?</strong></p><p>Following up, we gathered the most common topics that came up during retros in our own companies. Per each table, we picked one of the most common topic in the group and tried to brainstorm and come up with solutions to it. Anything that came into our mind, we would just put it on the wall. Next, we rotated tables, so each group would be facing another group‚Äôs post-its. It was time to try to group, remove, combine, add or modify the post-its done by the owners of the post-its. We did one round, so each group‚Äôs post-its have been visited by the 2 other groups. <strong>How easy was it to identify one solution for our initial topic?</strong></p><h2 id="case_study_kaizen_to_karoshi_-_sustainable_pace_and_performance_in_teams_by_john_clapham_johnc_bristol" tabindex="-1">Case Study: <em>Kaizen to Karoshi - sustainable pace and performance in teams</em> by John Clapham (@JohnC_Bristol)</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#case_study_kaizen_to_karoshi_-_sustainable_pace_and_performance_in_teams_by_john_clapham_johnc_bristol"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to ‚ÄúCase Study: Kaizen to Karoshi - sustainable pace and performance in teams by John Clapham (@JohnC_Bristol)‚Äù</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>John‚Äôs talk was pretty intense and his slides contained plenty of information so I limited myself to taking photos mostly.

There are many factors that contribute to this situation and at the same time, it is pretty difficult to notice and prevent, especially in a culture of continuous exponential growth and ‚Äúalways busyness‚Äù. There is not much awareness about the signs or causes of the burnouts, which is why I decided to join John‚Äôs presentation.</p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8160-1024x556.jpg" alt=""></p><p>What is burnout?</p><blockquote>‚ÄúA psychological syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishment‚Ä¶ as emotional resources are depleted workers feel they are no longer able to give themselves at psychological level‚Äù - Christina Maslach<p>‚ÄúBurnout really is a response to stress.
