<p>Maybe you heard, maybe you didn't, but there's a new challenge in town!</p><p>It's called <strong><a href="http://yourturnchallenge.strikingly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Turn Challenge</a></strong> and it's initiated by Winnie, the Special Projects Lead for <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Godin</a>. Now, it doesn't really matter who drives it, I've been wanting for some time to increase the number of my blog posts and get them coming in a more regular fashion.</p><p>The challenge consists in blogging every day of next week. All the posts will be gathered on a special <a href="http://yourturnchallenge.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> on <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumblr</a> and you can also post the articles on your own blog at the same time.</p><p>So, let's see, will I be able to post every day, for 7 days? You can join me and challenge yourself, it's also your turn! __</p><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/116250345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Turn Challenge Video</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user36205955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnie J.

If you were wondering, at the bottom of this, there's <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Godin</a>'s latest book, which I didn't get to read, yet: <a href="http://www.yourturn.link/products/your-turn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Turn</a>. Buy 1, get 2, so you can share one with your friends.</p>
