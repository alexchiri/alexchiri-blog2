<p>I have been reading an interesting book about the history of biking in the Netherlands written by an American. I have encountered some interesting facts.</p><h2 id="first_of_all_what_is_dinking" tabindex="-1">First of all, what is dinking?</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#first_of_all_what_is_dinking"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “First of all, what is dinking?”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>I intend to clear this mystery as fast as possible, with a quote from <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheFreeDictionary</a>:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;dink
adj
(Clothing &amp; Fashion) Scot and northern English dialect neat or neatly dressed
vb
Austral and NZ chiefly children's slang
a.  (tr) to carry (a second person) on a horse, bicycle, etc.
b.  (intr) (of two people) to travel together on a horse, bicycle, etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>It seems that in Australia and New Zealand this verb is used to name the action of carrying a second person on a bicycle, for example.</p><h2 id="ok_so_why_so_much_fuss_about_it" tabindex="-1">Ok, so why so much fuss about it?</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#ok_so_why_so_much_fuss_about_it"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Ok, so why so much fuss about it?”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Well, as Pete Jordan noticed, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-City-Bikes-Amsterdam-Cyclist/dp/0061995207/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378323519&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=In+the+City+of+Bikes%3A+The+Story+of+the+Amsterdam+Cyclist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>In the City of Bikes: The Story of the Amsterdam Cyclist</em></a>, this is something quite ordinary in the Netherlands, people carrying on the back of the bicycle their partners (life partners) or their children and so on.</p><p>What you don't know is, that &quot;dinking&quot; is illegal in the US and also in some European countries.</p><p>After some small searches on Google I found a <a href="http://bikeportland.org/2010/04/26/is-carrying-someone-on-your-bike-illegal-32538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> saying that this is illegal in Portland, USA and even the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highway Traffic Act</a> in Canada includes the following paragraph:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;Bicycle passengers
(2)  No person riding on a bicycle designed for carrying one person only shall carry any other person thereon. R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 178 (2).
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>In the UK, <a href="http://ukcyclerules.com/2011/09/13/cycling-carrying-passengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a man was fined</a> for carrying his child on his bike and it seems that for good reason, because the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British law</a> says something like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;24 Restriction of carriage of persons on bicycles.
(1)Not more than one person may be carried on a road on a bicycle not propelled by mechanical power unless it is constructed or adapted for the carriage of more than one person.
(2)In this section—
(a)references to a person carried on a bicycle include references to a person riding the bicycle, and
(b)“road” includes bridleway.
(3)If a person is carried on a bicycle in contravention of subsection (1) above, each of the persons carried is guilty of an offence.
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>The cherry on top of the cake is the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/pedestrians/special_regulations_for_pedestrians_and_cyclists/traffic_rules_and_regulations_for_cyclists_and_their_vehicles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU regulation</a> for road safety:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;The Vienna Convention prohibits the transport of passengers on bicycles, but enables the Contracting Parties to authorise exceptions. In some countries, the transport of a passenger is allowed only if he is under a statutory age limit (for instance 14 years in France) and if the cyclist himself has a minimum age
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>I was not able to find something about the Dutch law about this, but I would guess the Netherlands did authorise an exception to the law, considering the popularity of cycling here.</p><p>Whoever needed more proof that the Netherlands is a true biking paradise</p><p><img src="http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/ninja-tadaa.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Taken from <a href="http://ninjageisha.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/ta-daa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Illustration work by <a href="www.yukisnow.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.yukisnow.co.uk</a></p>
