<p>The third day of LAScot was a little bit shorter for me, because I chose to come back to Stockholm on the same day. That gave me just enough time to see the keynote and <a href="https://twitter.com/joakimsunden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JoakimSunden</a>’s talk about the “Spotify Model”.</p><h2 id="keynote_awesome_superproblems_by_luke_hohmann__lukehohmann" tabindex="-1">Keynote: <em>Awesome Superproblems</em> by Luke Hohmann (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukehohmann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ LukeHohmann</a>)</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#keynote_awesome_superproblems_by_luke_hohmann__lukehohmann"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Keynote: Awesome Superproblems by Luke Hohmann (@ LukeHohmann)”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Luke’s keynote was very inspiring. He demonstrated how our experience in building products and services can be used in other domains and parts of life. Using games to help community members to decide the budget of a whole city for the next year is an amazing feat. I wish more governments will follow suit and implement similar ways of allowing the people who they represent to contribute on running their country, region or city.</p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8379-1024x822.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8374-1024x601.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Collaboration starts with the goal, a meeting starts with the time</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8373-1024x614.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Games are the ideal collaboration tool</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8372-1024x581.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8371-1024x617.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>Lundy’s law: given enough time, any developer will find a reason for a total rewrite</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8370-1024x305.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8369-1024x659.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8368-1024x389.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8367-1024x687.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8366-1024x658.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8365-1024x685.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8361-1024x629.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8381-1024x614.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="case_study_you_can_do_better_than_the_spotify_model_by_joakim_sundén_joakimsunden" tabindex="-1">Case Study: <em>You can do better than the Spotify Model</em> by Joakim Sundén (<a href="https://twitter.com/joakimsunden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JoakimSunden</a>)</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#case_study_you_can_do_better_than_the_spotify_model_by_joakim_sundén_joakimsunden"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Case Study: You can do better than the Spotify Model by Joakim Sundén (@JoakimSunden)”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>I am convinced Joakim’s talk shattered a lot of people’s dreams, dreams of an ideal Spotify model of success, that can be easily copied and implemented in tech companies to make them successful. Truth is that even Spotify didn’t fully implement it and that the way Spotify organises itself is a living thing, that evolves and changes as the company changes. It is driven by company needs and unique context. Some things can be transplanted, but you should always take in the consideration your company’s needs and challenges and apply what it works for you.</p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8360-1024x747.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8358-1024x535.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8356-1024x528.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>In Spotify, tribe leads are responsible for organisation happiness, chapter leads responsible for delivery</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8355-1024x521.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>There is a manager for ~ every 5 individual contributor and a lead for ~ every 2 individual contributor</blockquote><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8354-1024x516.jpg" alt=""></p><p>This post is the last of a series of 3 posts, corresponding to the 3 days I attended at the conference: <a href="https://alexchiri.com/2017/10/09/lean-agile-scotland-day-1-4-oct-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes from the first day</a> and <a href="https://alexchiri.com/2017/10/12/lean-agile-scotland-day-2-5-oct-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes from the second day</a>.</p>
