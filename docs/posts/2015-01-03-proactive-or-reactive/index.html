<p>Just a few things I read this a couple of days ago about reactive/proactive:</p><p>&quot;Our behaviour is a function of our decisions, not our conditions&quot;. If we choose to blame others for our conditions, we become reactive.<br>&quot;Proactive people are driven by values - carefully thought about, selected and internationalised values&quot; while &quot;Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment&quot;.</p><p>Reactive language:</p><pre><code>  * There's nothing I can do.
  * That's just the way I am.
  * He makes me so mad.
  * They won't allow that.
  * I have to do that.
  * I can't.
  * I must.
  * If only.
</code></pre><p>Proactive language:</p><pre><code>  * Let's look at our alternatives.
  * I can choose a different approach.
  * I control my own feelings.
  * I can create an effective presentation.
  * I will choose an appropriate response.
  * I choose.
  * I prefer.
  * I will.
