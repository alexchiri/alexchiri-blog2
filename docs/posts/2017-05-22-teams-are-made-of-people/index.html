<p>I think this is quite an obvious thing to say. At the same time, it is quite common to forget what this fact means. What does it mean that this team that provides a service, or builds a product or works on a project, what does it mean that it is made of people? And to the extent of that, what does it mean that the users or the stakeholders are also people?</p><p>Any person has ambitions and needs. Some of them are quite basic like eating and being loved or being part of a group and some are a bit more abstract, like feeling respected or accomplished. We spend all our life chasing one or the other. And unless you are a Buddhist monk in one of the most deserted corners of the world, being self-sufficient, then you will need other people to fulfil your ambition.</p><p>So your users (internal or external) are people like you, with ambitions and needs, who expect great service and are busy chasing their own path in life. With this in mind, let’s focus a bit more on the team.</p><h2 id="what_does_this_mean_for_the_team" tabindex="-1">What does this mean for the team?</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#what_does_this_mean_for_the_team"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “What does this mean for the team?”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>I assume that the people you have in your team are there by choice and they made this choice because it somehow contributes to their ambitions. This being said, here are a few things you should have in mind when in a team of people.</p><h3 id="human_chemistry_and_trust" tabindex="-1">Human chemistry and trust</h3><a class="direct-link" href="#human_chemistry_and_trust"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Human chemistry and trust”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Different personalities, different ways of communicating and interacting with each other, some just collaborate harmoniously, some need a little bit of work.</p><p>Very few people work well with complete strangers. So make sure the members of the team feel comfortable with each other. Run all kind of exercises like <a href="https://alexchiri.com/2016/08/28/my-personal-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal maps</a>, go out for beers, team building, whatever it takes to break the ice. Team members don’t have to be best buddies, but they should be comfortable enough with each other in order to collaborate effectively for a big chunk of the time they are awake every day. The next step is to trust each other. This is not about being open about the most personal things. It’s about being comfortable and have enough trust in your co-workers so you can feel safe to make mistakes and be wrong about some things.</p><p>Be aware of the <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/63/6/384/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four stages of forming a team</a>, the team will reach the level of high performance much faster if you consciously address issues typical for any of the stages.</p><p>Identifying personality types in the team could be an interesting idea to explore. There are <a href="https://businesschemistry.deloitte.com/Login/Index?ReturnUrl=%2f#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> tests and guidelines out there. As long as you take them with a pinch of salt and stay away of labelling everyone with their dominant traits. The biggest outcome of knowing this is to be aware that there might be certain tendencies in the team towards different behaviours or that members of the team tend to be more open towards certain behaviours.</p><p><em>A team of people needs a an environment where they can feel safe to fail and admit when they’re wrong. They need trust.</em></p><h3 id="on-boarding" tabindex="-1">On-boarding</h3><a class="direct-link" href="#on-boarding"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “On-boarding”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Whenever you get a new person in the team, the team’s culture is put to a test. A person with a fresh perspective is joining the team. Take this opportunity to rethink the way you do things. Don’t see it as a threat, but encourage the new person to challenge everything, but maybe in a controlled way.</p><p>Make sure you have a simple but somewhat structured way to bring the new member up-to-speed with the team’s knowledge. Personally, I love <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2017/03/15/jangrape/how-to-onboard-a-new-team-member-faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the idea</a> of having a set of topics the team masters written on cards. Whenever a new person joins, he/she receives a copy and he/she is responsible for learning about those from the other team colleagues. Maybe add some time restrictions and make sure you mention what is the goal of the knowledge sharing and time restrictions, if any.</p><p>Encourage mentors that are (preferably) not direct managers of the new recruits <a href="https://alexchiri.com/2017/03/27/mentorship-play-for-the-long-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to help them get settled and advise them in their career</a> inside the company. It pays off for both the mentors and the mentees, which in the end benefits the company.</p><p><em>A team is made of people who need to feel that they belong to the group and receive the proper support in order to excel and develop their skills.</em></p><h3 id="simple_process_based_on_context" tabindex="-1">Simple process based on context</h3><a class="direct-link" href="#simple_process_based_on_context"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Simple process based on context”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>The discussion about how to organise efficiently a group of people is probably as old as human life on Earth.</p><p>Nowadays, lean and agile are the most common hypes and misconceptions in the IT industry.
