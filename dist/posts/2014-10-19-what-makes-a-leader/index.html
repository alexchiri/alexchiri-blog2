<p>Like I probably said before, I read quite a lot of books, especially business and self-help books. I found out a few weeks ago about <a href="http://www.danielgoleman.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Goleman</a>'s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Makes-Leader-Emotional-Intelligence/dp/1934441740/ref=tmm_pap_title_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What makes a leader?</a>. The book is basically a collection of posts he did on <a href="http://hbr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a> along the years, starting with <a href="http://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader/ar/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one</a> that has the same title as the book and was initially published in 1998.</p><p>The trouble with all these books is that if you don't do something concrete with them right away, you'll probably forget most of their content. Because I don't have time to reread them all the time, I decided some time ago to do mind maps, so I can quickly remind myself what the book was about. That didn't work out all the time, but the first article from this book &quot;screamed&quot; for one, so there it is. You can glimpse it in the cover or download it from <a href="http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/What%20makes%20a%20leader%3F.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in the subjects of leadership or emotional intelligence (EQ), I urge you to read it!</p>
