<p>Sadly this was the last day of <a href="http://jfokus.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jfokus</a> and it was pretty cool!</p><h2 id="magic_tricks_with_git" tabindex="-1">Magic tricks with Git</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#magic_tricks_with_git"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Magic tricks with Git”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Third day of Jfokus started brilliantly with a very cool talk about Git given by <a href="https://twitter.com/tlberglund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Berglund</a> of DataStax.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;Which of you are new to git?&quot; Most of the room raises the hand.&quot;Maybe you should leave!&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/warmup?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#warmup</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/joke?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#joke</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jfokus?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#jfokus</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/git?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#git</a> <a href="https://t.co/8y97ipeXu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8y97ipeXu8</a></p></blockquote><p>— Alexandru Chirițescu (@alexchiri) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/697330579931586560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Tim showed us how to do a commit without actually using the <code>git commit</code> command. How else, you would wonder? Well, simple! By creating each and every file that gets normally created in .git folder when <code>git commit</code> is called. And this way making git think that we did an actual commit. Awesome, informative and quite entertaining! Next in the menu was a demo of how to use <code>git rebase -i</code>, pretty much the only way we should use rebase, according to Tim.</p><p>I created a small <a href="https://mm.tt/649051925?t=ZlKaosKk8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindmap</a> of the talk, not that well organised as the rhythm was quite alert.</p><h2 id="concurrent_or_parallel" tabindex="-1">Concurrent or parallel?</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#concurrent_or_parallel"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Concurrent or parallel?”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Goetz</a> talked about the difference between concurrency and parallelism and why software is not ready to handle more cores. Really interesting talk and now the slides are available <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus16/preso/ConcurrentToParallel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="cache_java_cache_jcache" tabindex="-1">Cache, Java Cache, JCache</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#cache_java_cache_jcache"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Cache, Java Cache, JCache”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>From what I understood <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCache</a> wants to be to caching what <a href="http://hibernate.org/orm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hibernate</a> is to persistence. If you want caching in your app, you implement it and then choose one of the compatible JCache providers.</p><p>Cool introduction to the theory of caching during the presentation, <a href="https://twitter.com/gregrluck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Luck</a>, CEO of <a href="http://hazelcast.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hazelcast</a>. Of course, I did a <a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/649112869?t=1Oj4iSg2uK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindmap</a>.</p><h2 id="reactive_what_is_reactive" tabindex="-1">Reactive? What is reactive?</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#reactive_what_is_reactive"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Reactive? What is reactive?”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Now this was interesting. <a href="https://twitter.com/elmanu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuel Bernhardt</a> described how a reactive app looks like with Play framework. I will be honest, I couldn't really follow the code changes, too many new things and concepts. And I think I wasn't the only one. A simple summary of the presentation came in the end, in the shape of a question:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;So basically reactive means using callbacks, right?
Yes, but also handling errors. 
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Manuel finished his presentation and coding session pretty fast so he had time to show us a few other things. I recall 2 cool tools for load testing your apps:</p><pre><code>  * [Gatling](http://gatling.io/#/) - an open-source load testing framework based on Scala, Akka and Netty
  * [Bees with Machine Guns!](https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns) - a utility for arming (creating) many bees (micro EC2 instances) to attack (load test) targets (web applications).

Some of the memorable jokes:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>The actual reason for this talk, the Spring ASCII art, <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@starbuxman</a> and The Bootiful Application <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jfokus?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#jfokus</a> <a href="https://t.co/TzrOYlQe92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TzrOYlQe92</a></p></blockquote><p>— Alexandru Chirițescu (@alexchiri) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/697412108573667328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2016</a></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;Who's using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Netbeans?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Netbeans</a>? ...

I really liked how the jars created by a Boot app are also bash scripts. So you could place the jar inside init.d folder and your app would be started automatically at boot. Also you could start your app by simply running the jar as any other shell script.</p>
