<p>Having a small blog where you can ramble about whatever you want should be a simple thing, right? I mean you don't pay much to the host, they have installation scripts for any platform you like, you just buy a domain (if you want) and you start writing! Well, that's only in theory, at least for me.</p><p>It all started a few months ago with my domain <code>alexchiri.ro</code> just disappearing from the records of my host at that time, <a href="http://icebluehost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">icebluehost.com</a>. '<em>Weird</em>', I said to myself and opened a ticket. They did 'something' and then the domain worked again, but I wasn't able to see it in my <a href="http://cpanel.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPanel</a> and I couldn't add MX records to it so I can receive emails @alexchiri.ro on <a href="http://gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMail</a>.</p><p>The next logical step was to open another ticket, this time for not being able to add MX records. Now it gets funnier: they did 'something' again but after that it was not working anymore and I wasn't able to see it in <a href="http://cpanel.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPanel</a> (sounds familiar?). What pissed me of was that they were not telling me anything, just to wait for it to be fixed. I waited for a few days, in the meantime I was asking for updates everyday, to which they stopped answering after the first 2 days.</p><p><em>'That's it'</em>, I said. <em>'I might be small and insignificant to you, but I have my pride!'</em>, so I went to <a href="http://eurovps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroVPS</a>. Created a new shared account, moved the domain and took the opportunity to update <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress</a> to 3.5, change the theme and revise the plug-ins I used.</p><p>As you might have guessed, this wasn't the end of it, because 2 weeks ago the new hosting was hacked, my freshly moved blog was completely erased and I didn't get even a mail from <a href="http://eurovps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroVPS</a> to let me know about the fact.</p><p>That's when I decided to move to a static blog, where my posts are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a> and hosted in <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://scriptogr.am" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scriptogr.am</a> generates static htmls from it. I also attached <code>alexchiri.com</code> to my account to make my blog a bit more international!</p><p>I know the change doesn't make a lot of sense, but it feels good to try something new and I was really sick of reinstalling <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress</a> and restoring the backed up database and so on. On top of that, this is completely FREE!</p><p><strong>There's this 'minor' problem about the old posts, from the <code>alexchiri.ro</code> era (I like it how it sounds! :D), I'll have to move them somehow, but that's a problem for the future!</strong></p>
