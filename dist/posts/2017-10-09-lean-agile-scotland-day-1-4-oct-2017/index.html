<p>This year was the first time I attended LAScot and I had high expectations from it. I wasn’t disappointed even just one bit!</p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8267-2-1024x756.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I enjoyed the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. There is no right and there is no wrong, no superior or inferior, there’s just sharing, learning and lots of fruitful conversations. It’s the perfect environment for nurturing old friendships and growing new ones on the ground of common interests and a passion for the diverse fields that constitute and contribute to the knowledge work most of us are doing.</p><p>My goal with these posts (3 in total, 3 days) is to share my key learnings from the sessions I attended, based on my notes. But as much as I tried to write down most of it, most of the talks were quite fast paced and I am quite rusty at taking notes.</p><h2 id="" tabindex="-1"></h2><a class="direct-link" href="#"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><h2 id="keynote_first_principles_-_what_don’t_we_know_by_kate_gray_grisgraygrau" tabindex="-1">Keynote: <em>First Principles - what don’t we know?</em> by Kate Gray (@grisgraygrau)</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#keynote_first_principles_-_what_don’t_we_know_by_kate_gray_grisgraygrau"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Keynote: First Principles - what don’t we know? by Kate Gray (@grisgraygrau)”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8265-2-1024x681.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>“So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work” - Peter Drucker</blockquote><p>Kate gave a talk about enabling conversations between all parts of an organisation. Between managers and the people they manage, between executives and employees ranking low in the organisation tree. It was a talk about understanding what is the most effective way to communicate across the hierarchy and getting a seat at the discussion table when big changes are planned.</p><blockquote>No manager wakes up thinking “I just want to stick it to my teams!”</blockquote><p>Many times when companies want to make a decision about how to be more efficient or accelerate growth, they bring in external consultants from companies like McKinsey.</p><p><img src="/img/2017/10/IMG_8264-2-1024x727.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote>How did Scott get into the room?</blockquote><p>There is so much information but it’s very difficult to connect the dots.

It needs to also be <strong>relevant</strong>, so get to know your execs, what happens in their world and choose your timing well. Your language has to be <strong>consistent</strong> so it doesn’t create confusion.</p><blockquote>Don’t stop your work and develop a glossary, because that would get you to drink</blockquote><p>It’s important how you show or tell information, to avoid getting the execs to wonder “What’s going on?” while they listen to you.</p><p>And finally, make your language <strong>familiar</strong>.</p><h3 id="attitude" tabindex="-1">Attitude</h3><a class="direct-link" href="#attitude"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Attitude”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Have an attitude of <strong>purpose</strong>, with <strong>empathy</strong> (some people are jerks, but most people are not), be <strong>generous</strong> (even with those management consultancies that are out for a quick buck) and be <strong>humble</strong> (although it’s not easy when someone is doing the power-play)</p><h3 id="experience" tabindex="-1">Experience</h3><a class="direct-link" href="#experience"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Experience”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Think of your <strong>mental model</strong> and have you made any assumptions about the other person?</p><p>Be <strong>responsible</strong> and get to know more about the business. It’s pretty common to have a person advocating agile and didn’t have the time to get a holistic view of the business. It’s often a source of conflict.</p><p>Have a look at this animation based on a Simon Sinek talk about intensity and consistency:</p><blockquote>Find ways to have better relationships with your executives</blockquote><p>It takes time.
