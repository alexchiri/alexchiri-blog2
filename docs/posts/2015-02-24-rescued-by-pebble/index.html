<p>I had a <a href="https://getpebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble</a> Steel watch for over a year now, but never took the time to put together an app or a watchface for it. Recently, I started testing <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RescueTime</a> out of curiosity to see how much of my time is spent on &quot;productive&quot; things and how much on not so productive things.</p><p>Not much later I found myself refreshing the <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RescueTime</a> dashboard every now and then to see how much I score on their stats. But that wasn't too convenient, not to mention productive! __</p><p>After a short period of time where I used a <a href="http://blink1.thingm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blink(1)</a> connected to my <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RescueTime</a> account as a basic representation of my perceived productivity, I said, &quot;Hey, why don't I use Pebble for this?&quot;. So that's how I got to do the simple <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54eccb83732a680613000007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Rescued by Pebble&quot;</a> watchface.</p><p>The watchface connects to the API provided by <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RescueTime</a> and determines how productive you were in the last 5 minutes. The data returned contains how many seconds you have spent in different levels of productivity. From this data I calculate a weighted average which later on I display in the watchface as a progress bar and it influences which of the 4 faces you see on display.</p><p>So now I try to keep my Pebble smiling all the time!</p><p>P.S. I plan to release several updates to it, like vibration when the productivity is low and show offline time as well</p><p>P.P.S My code is on <a href="https://github.com/alexchiri/rescued-by-pebble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a>, so if you're interested, go check it out!</p><p>P.P.P.S Pff, by the time I released this watchface, a new <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises/description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble</a> watch is out and soon another SDK. Shouldn't look bad in color either! __</p>
