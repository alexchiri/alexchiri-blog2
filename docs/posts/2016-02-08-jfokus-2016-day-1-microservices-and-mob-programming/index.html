Being a very beginner in this topic, I decided to focus mostly on it through the <a href="http://jfokus.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jfokus</a> conference this year.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/crichardson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Richardson</a>'s tutorial, <em>Introduction to microservices</em> was comprehensive, taking us through the basic concepts, patterns and strategies behind them. Without going too much into details, there was lots of useful content and the presentation consists a good base to understand what are microservices about and give you several points to continue to find out more on your own. I suggest you follow Chris and especially go check out <a href="http://microservices.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservices.io</a> for even more material on the topic.</p><p>If you're curious about some of the ideas he shared during the presentation, check out <a href="https://mm.tt/647630949?t=HSTn9Fvvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the mindmap I did</a> during the talk. It's quite large, I suggest you expand branches while you go.</p><h2 id="no_were_not_gaming_we_are_mob_programming" tabindex="-1">No we're not gaming, we are Mob programming!</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#no_were_not_gaming_we_are_mob_programming"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “No we're not gaming, we are Mob programming!”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Although I said I want to focus on microservices, the Mob programming workshop was one of reasons I decided to go to the conference. I have been interested for a while in &quot;alternative&quot; development processes and I have been following <a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Zuill</a> online for some time. Not just for <code>#MobProgramming</code> but also for <code>#NoEstimates</code>.</p><p>And the workshop was a really good experience. We did several exercises to feel some of the pains I'm sure everyone experienced in &quot;agile&quot; development. Notice the quotes. Yes, I am talking about estimates, requirements and all that mess. Mob programming brings the focus on the basic values of Agile, big highlight on people and interactions and working software. We briefly demonstrated how it works through some more exercises, but also through 2 short sessions of Mob programming while trying to solve the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman Numerals Kata</a>.</p><p>I recommend following <a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody</a> and his work and understanding the concepts behind it. There's plenty to learn!</p>
