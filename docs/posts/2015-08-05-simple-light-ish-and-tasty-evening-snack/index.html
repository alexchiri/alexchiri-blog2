<p>Fancy a delicious evening snack, but you don't want to feel too guilty about the extra calories?</p><p>Then I present you the Crunchy-Tomato-Garlicky-Madness!!! Isn't that a tongue twister? Never-mind, I still have to work on the marketing part, I'll figure it out later.</p><h2 id="ingredients" tabindex="-1">Ingredients</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#ingredients"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Ingredients”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Now go grab from your local grocery store the following and get munching (2 portions):</p><ul><li>1 large sized tomato (with the least plastic as possible)</li><li>crackers / hard bread (more fibre, less unhealthy stuff)</li><li>3-4 cloves of fresh green garlic (not that frozen ages ago Chinese crap)</li><li>chives</li><li>dried tomato paste (optional, brings some extra flavour kick, also calories)</li><li>shredded old cheese flakes (optional, but...)</li><li>olive oil</li><li>lemon juice / vinegar</li><li>salt</li></ul><h2 id="the_process" tabindex="-1">The process</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#the_process"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “The process”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Get 2 crackers and put a thin layer of the tomato paste on them. I said thin, don't push it!</p><p>Slice that tomato as you like and spread the slices evenly between the crackers.</p><p>Chop a healthy amount of chives and spread them on top of the tomatoes.</p><p>Take some of that shredded cheese and throw some of it on top of the chives.</p><p>Press the garlic cloves, put them in a cup and give them a healthy rubbing with some olive oil and salt. Don't be lazy, keep working them until they get white-ish! Spread the garlic on top of the chives.</p><p>And finally, put a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar on the whole thing for the final twist.</p><p>There you have it! Now go enjoy it, you can thank me later! ;)</p>
