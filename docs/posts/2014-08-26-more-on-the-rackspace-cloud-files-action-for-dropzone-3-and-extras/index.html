<p>Not so long ago, I released my first <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone 3</a> action and of course, I <a href="http://www.alexchiri.com/post/rackspace-cloud-files-action-for-dropzone-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about it</a> on my blog!</p><p>After two weeks (back to the present) and some <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a> tutorials later, I improved the action and also added some more features to it.</p><h2 id="features_features_fea…" tabindex="-1">Features, features, fea…</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#features_features_fea…"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Features, features, fea…”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>One feature request I got on <a href="https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/499249015855521792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> was to add support for custom domains (or CNAME records) for the remote containers:</p><blockquote>[@alexchiri](https://twitter.com/alexchiri) [@aptonic](https://twitter.com/aptonic) Just tried it out. I'm going to use this quite a bit. Now for a feature request - Specify a CNAME for the container.<p>— Alan Bush (@alanbush) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanbush/statuses/499389665846116352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>That was quite easy to do! But then I thought that I needed something a bit more challenging, so I decided to attack the problem with showing progress for file uploads and also supporting large[1] files</p><p>And that needed a bit more research, because the model that <a href="http://fog.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fog</a> provides does not allow you to do these things. So I asked for some help and the answer was to use a lower level API method:</p><blockquote>[@alexchiri](https://twitter.com/alexchiri) Yes. I think you have to use the put_object request instead of models, but you can pass a block which should give progress.<p>— Wesley Beary (@geemus) <a href="https://twitter.com/geemus/statuses/501375108523372545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>After a few iterations, I managed to get it working and got two new features for the action in one shot (almost)!</p><h2 id="extras" tabindex="-1">Extras</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#extras"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Extras”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>In the meantime, encouraged by the success of the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rackspace Cloud Files</a> action, I started working on two other actions: one for <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a>, the team collaboration platform and one for <a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Drive</a>.</p><p>These two, while they are working, they’re still not there and this is the reason they are not available on <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone</a>’s website yet, but you can manually install them from the <a href="https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions-zipped" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropzone3-actions-zipped</a> repo on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, which is constantly built whenever there are updates to the <a href="https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropzone-actions</a> repo.</p><p>Go check them out, I’d love to hear your feedback!</p><ol><li>Rackspace requires all files larger than 5GB to be split in segments. ↩</li></ol>
