They create this model of the company in their mind and they stop being receptive as change happens around them?</p>\n<p>It almost sounds like people get confirmation bias the more they work in a company, looking for the signs that confirm that the company is the same as they got to know over the years. Until it’s too late, either because the company has changed so much that it becomes unrecognisable or the employee leaves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change_and_the_model\" tabindex=\"-1\">Change and the model</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#change_and_the_model\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Change and the model”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>But do companies actually change? Or are there companies that don’t change?</p>\n<p>I would say all companies change in some ways. It’s impossible not to. Either as a response to the external conditions surrounding them or simply because people come and go. People tend to have an impact on their work and the higher the rank, the higher the potential impact (negative or positive).</p>\n<p>Companies with an influential CEO tend to follow their CEOs whims as long as they are in charge. Some things might change, but some things stay the same.</p>\n<p>Also, change in companies can be localised. For the same reasons, external factors and different people working there.</p>\n<p>Where am I going to with this rant? I think that in the same way it happens between couples that have known each other for a long time, the more we work in a company, the less we might become receptive to what happens in the company. We might obsess over the bad things or be hypnotised by the perceived good things. Either way, it’s good to stop and reflect on our assumptions. Is the model we have in our head about the company still accurate? Do we even realise what ingrained opinions we have about our employer or workplace?</p>\n<h2 id=\"organisational_change\" tabindex=\"-1\">Organisational change</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#organisational_change\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Organisational change”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I have always thought about the companies that want to bring internal change and they hire external consultants for that. The general reason is that in order to bring change they need expertise that is lacking internally, but also because they need an impartial and fresh view. This made sense at a first glance, but at the same time it didn’t. Wouldn't someone who knows the company best be the perfect match to bring change? How could a stranger know what is best for this particular company?</p>\n<p>I guess it is the same way as in therapy (I assume, since I've never been to one). There are therapists who prescribe you things without knowing much about you and there are therapists who are merely helping you dig inside you and have a look at your internal &quot;models&quot;. I believe that the latter have better chances for success. A company, as an individual, cannot change if there isn't a will at all levels. An external party helping to bring change should facilitate this internal exploration of assumptions. An external cannot change a company, not in a meaningful way, they can only facilitate opportunities for the employees of the company to bring change themselves.</p>\n<p>The internal mental models we build over time about our loved ones or our companies help us communicate effectively, but they seem to also make us not see when the models are not accurate anymore. Change is hard anyway, but it gets even harder when done towards unrealistic models.</p>\n",

Code is being used to produce something else from it. You write the same code, you should get the same thing from it. This means that if code produces issues, you should be able to reproduce the issues and the environment that caused the issues using the same code. At the same time, code producing stable deliverables can be re-used over and over again to create those.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatable</strong>. Deliverables can be created from code in an automatic way. Which means more time can be invested in the parts of work that cannot be automated.</li>\n<li><strong>Scaleability</strong>.

Each of these can be split in multiple more specialized areas. And each of these areas can grow into platforms of their own.</p>\n<p>There are some disadvantages in doing everything as-code, but I guess the biggest is that the time investment that it needs. For some things, this might simply not be worth it. One-off tasks that you do once and forget are probably not worth it. It depends on the advantages and disadvantages. As anything which requires a bigger investment in the beginning, it might seem better to “just do it!” in whatever simple way you can in the moment.

I read on a blog about this new book that was describing 4 team topologies that all companies doing modern software development should strive to adopt. One of these 4 team topologies was the platform team. The book is called “Team Topologies” by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais and I didn’t read it until this year (2022). Which was good because what I read resonated better with my experience over the years with platform teams. It is a great book and I think that anyone involved in software development should read it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reduce_cognitive_load\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reduce cognitive load</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#reduce_cognitive_load\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Reduce cognitive load”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In my previous posts, I more or less defined platforms as pieces of software that abstract common pieces of concern across teams. In the book, there is one sentence describing “platform teams” from a different perspective:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The platform team provides internal services to reduce the cognitive load that would be required from stream-aligned teams to develop these underlying services. - <em>Team Topologies</em> by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We could say that this is one of the purposes of platform teams: to reduce cognitive load of stream-aligned teams (one of the other 3 team topologies described in the book). But not in such a way that it reduces the ownership of stream-aligned teams of their product slice.</p>\n<p>I think that Team Topologies does a way better job than I could do to describe platform teams, so if you are interested into this topic, I suggest you get the book and dive in!

The reason to strive for having long-living teams is that creating a new team, bringing complete strangers together and asking them to collaborate together towards a common goal and many times working together in the same units of work, takes a lot of time. It is an investment. For the company, but also for the team members. You want to profit from that investment as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Since there are no identical people, with identical preferences, identical contexts and backgrounds, people need to get used to each other (in time), but also need to learn what is the best way to interact with each other. With no explicit rules, each person will assume things about the others based on their perspective of others and of the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team_norms\" tabindex=\"-1\">Team norms</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#team_norms\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Team norms”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>For all these reasons, I believe that one of the very first things a new team should do is to have a conversation about team norms. The purpose is to bring out the perspective about work of each team member, agree on ways to work together based on these perspectives and make it ok for team members to hold each other accountable without generating frustration.</p>\n<p>Basically the team members should agree on the following things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How do we like to do things in this team?</li>\n<li>What do we consider inappropriate?</li>\n<li>How should we hold each other accountable?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, running meetings over time might be something some team members dislike a lot (inappropriate), so the team agree that they will never run over time, that they will always stop 5 min before time and evaluate if a new meeting is required (how we do things). Anyone in the team should bring it up if it seems a meeting is dragging on without point or if the 5 minute mark has passed (accountability).</p>\n<p>This might seem an impossible exercise at this point in team timeline, because there might be little trust in the team and maybe some people won’t be completely honest, but with some facilitation it should be possible to get a good result.</p>\n<p>It’s important to have everyone express their opinions and preference and avoid having the loudest person in the room dominating. It is also useful to give some preparation time, either before the meeting or during the meeting, not everyone can come up with things like these on the spot.</p>\n<p>The answers to each of these questions could be different for everyone. And that is fine. If the members of the team want to get along and work together effectively, then they need to take all these preferences into consideration. If they do not, or they don’t discuss about them, then the differences in opinion and perspective will come up when the times get tough and they will cause frustration and separation (also team productivity will drop).</p>\n<p>P.S. A connection of mine on LinkedIn said recently that software development would be less complex if done by machines (AI). I tend to agree, but until we get there, we need to remember that we are not machines and try to work out our differences in the open.</p>\n",

If teams have freedom to choose their technologies and ways of working (and they should, within limits), there will be a period of extreme volatility and experimentation in how each product team is developing their slice of product. Starting a platform at this point for deploying or monitoring or most other functions could be a bit premature.</p>\n<p>Platforms usually arise from identifying common needs among product teams. But the product teams need some time to figure things out when they are just starting out. Most of them at this stage have no clear idea of what their needs are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"too_late\" tabindex=\"-1\">Too late</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#too_late\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Too late”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I don’t think that it is ever too late to start a platform.

And then the cycle repeats itself.</p>\n<p>This is not something that happens naturally, in my experience. There needs to be a constant watch from a higher level and common patterns to be identified. During the experimentation period, someone with a higher level view across teams and departments (architects, staff+ people) can observe patterns but also guide the teams to make better decisions.</p>\n<p>I hope it is not a surprise that the answer to the question in the title is the classical “It depends!“. As most things, it depends on the context. Still, it’s good to allow experimentation in the early stages and consolidate later. Prescribing everything in the beginning could end up with having systems and platforms that look good on paper, but are not in touch with the realities of the teams where they should be implemented and the products they are supposed to support.</p>\n",

What do I mean by that? Imagine a platform team that provides a CI/CD build platform. This might be run on Kubernetes on-prem or in cloud. It’s basically some containers serving https, some runners and some databases, right? Well, from this point of view, why couldn’t this platform run also Redis clusters for engineering teams?

The platform team owns the CI/CD builds platform and offers support on how the platform is used, but are not responsible if its users are misusing the platform. If there is an incident because CI/CD pipelines not working for one of the product slices, the platform team should not be called unless something is wrong with the platform.</p>\n<p>With the platform team owning everything that is not related to a product slice in the platform, it means that whatever tooling the platform consists of should be a matter of expertise for the members of the platform team.

The reason is obvious:</p>\n<p>How can you manage and improve something you don’t understand deeply?

It’s like saying “wet water”. Do we want to have any other kind?</p>\n<p>In my view, DevOps is a mentality with set of principles for all engineers, not just the ones working with platforms. But that dam was breached and we cannot go back, the flow of water is too strong and it is gaining more and more momentum.</p>\n<p>So I guess we will have to live with “DevOps Engineers” in  “DevOps teams” in “DevOps departments” in companies that “are now DevOps”.</p>\n<p>It is not all lost though. We might have screwed the pooch with the terms, but I think that the resulting pattern of having platform teams is an important piece of having only “DevOps teams”. If done right, if…</p>\n<p>In order for product teams in large companies to work in a DevOps way, they need great platforms that allow them to own their slice of product end-to-end. The platforms reduce complexity for deployment, monitoring, building and others so that product teams can handle these on their own using these platforms. They own their “pipelines”, their monitoring dashboards, their on-call alerts and so on and so forth and the platform teams makes sure the platforms are in tip-top shape and they are done in a way that ensure the product teams independence.</p>\n<p>And that is an ideal worth fighting for!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>This is one of those things that most people agree with in theory, but it somehow escapes the implementation.</p>\n<p>I have been working for some time now in teams building infrastructure platforms and one common issue I see often is not including checks on the newly created infrastructure in the pipeline that creates it. By infrastructure I mean Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, serverless, you name it!</p>\n<p>In the name of keeping the pipeline duration short, these checks are not included. By not including them, the ✅ of the pipeline means the tooling had finished executing successfully and not that the infrastructure is ready, even though it’s common to consider it ready.</p>\n<p>In my view, having the pipeline finishing successfully without knowing that its artefact is ready to use makes no sense. It’s like manufacturing a product and releasing it without checking it for defects. It will lead to increased returns that are expensive and damage the brands credibility.</p>\n<p>In infra world, the same thing happens. When the pipeline finishes, the users of the infra will expect it to be working, when it fact, it might be starting up or be broken. If the result doesn’t match the expectations of the users, then they will reach out to the infra team for support.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, if creation pipelines includes checks or tests, it could be triggered automatically in branches or PRs, to increase the confidence in the changes made there to the platform, before they are merged into the <code>main</code> branch.</p>\n",

This post is not about giving a (or the best) way on how to test pipelines, because frankly I don’t know one myself. I will try though to throw some ideas out there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do_we_even_need_to_test_the_pipelines\" tabindex=\"-1\">Do we even need to test the pipelines?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#do_we_even_need_to_test_the_pipelines\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Do we even need to test the pipelines?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Before discussing about testing pipelines, a reasonable question is if we even need to test them?</p>\n<p>My simple answer is yes! Why? Because they are code. Code that influences how our application code is built, tested and deployed. Any bug in the pipeline code will have an impact on the deliverable that ends up being used by our users.</p>\n<p>The application code might be perfect, but our users might still be experiencing issues because of bugs in the pipelines code. Which is a nasty kind of bug, if you ask me, because is not part of the application code.</p>\n<p>On top of this, we know that the application code is not perfect. Pipelines play an even more important role of facilitating various tests and checks being run on the application code. Pipelines enhance our trust in the application code we write. If pipelines run green, then we know we have done the best we could to ship good code. But what makes sure that the pipelines do what they are supposed to do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"we_do_need_tests_for_pipelines\" tabindex=\"-1\">We do need tests for pipelines.</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#we_do_need_tests_for_pipelines\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “We do need tests for pipelines.”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I hope that the arguments above for testing pipelines make sense and that you are convinced of the benefits of doing so. We might not need to test all pipelines, in the same way we might not want to achieve 100% code coverage. After a certain point, the effort does not make sense.</p>\n<p>Most pipelines I have written or saw are a mix of YAML or other descriptive format (let’s call these <em>pipeline definitions</em>) and scripts. Scripts should be easy to test, but what about the pipeline definitions?</p>\n<h2 id=\"pipeline_definitions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pipeline definitions</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#pipeline_definitions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Pipeline definitions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Pipelines definitions are files that define what the pipeline should do. They have many names and they come in different formats, although most of the solutions seem to have a preference for YAML.</p>\n<p>As projects grow, there is a tendency for the pipelines to explode in size and more and more decisions to be done in the pipeline definitions. More than that, some pipeline solutions allow to re-use pipelines (or parts of pipelines) in other pipelines, so you don’t duplicate parts which are doing the same thing. Like one would do with regular code.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately pipeline definitions are not quite like regular code. Main aspect here is readability. Re-using pipelines as mentioned above makes the complexity of the pipelines and debugging them explode. While it might seem like a cool solution from a geeky engineering way, figuring out what happens where and how in these composed pipelines can turn into a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Finally, each pipeline and its components could be seen as a function with inputs and outputs. With the important detail that many pipelines have many secondary effects as outputs, so they don’t return something, but they do something instead. Testing them is hard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts\" tabindex=\"-1\">Thoughts</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#thoughts\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Thoughts”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>As I mentioned in the beginning, I don’t know a good solution for this. Searching around the internet for the most popular pipeline tools, doesn’t give much satisfactory results. Here are some of my thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep as much of the pipeline code as scripts</strong>. Scripts are easier to test, as long as they are written in a good way. Create tests for these scripts and run them in a simple separate pipeline, whenever their code changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Split pipelines when complexity grows</strong>. Instead of having a big pipeline that does different things based on inputs, split it in smaller ones. This makes it easier to follow through what each pipeline does, especially when it is not working as intended.</li>\n<li><strong>Write unit tests for the pipeline</strong>. <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/JenkinsPipelineUnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Some technologies</a> have tools to test the actual pipeline definitions. You can have simple pipelines executing these pipeline tests.</li>\n<li><strong>Execute pipelines locally</strong>. <a href=\"https://github.com/nektos/act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Some technologies</a> have tools to run the pipelines locally. This is especially handy when debugging why pipelines don’t work as intended. Being able to run the pipelines locally makes the feedback loop faster, by removing the need to wait on runners to start and run.</li>\n</ol>\n",

I think the idea is good in principle, but I don’t like that many companies make them mandatory. If they are for the employees, then let it be their choice if they have them or not.</p>\n<p>And second, many companies come with all kind of forms that need to be filled in during these meetings and submitted in random internal platforms with a horrible user experience. It’s good to suggest a format, but again give the possibility to the employee to shape the it, or refuse it altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"focus_on_the_positive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Focus on the positive</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#focus_on_the_positive\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Focus on the positive”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Rant about performance review meetings finished, one format that I liked to suggest (when I used to have these meetings with people reporting to me) is one inspired by “The Solutions Focus” approach to driving positive change. This is something I learned about from Paul Z. Jackson and Mark McKergow’s great book “The Solutions Focus: Making Coaching &amp; Change SIMPLE”.</p>\n<p>I find that it is constructive to focus on the positive and where we want to get rather than dwelling on what is wrong now or was in the past. Especially in this kind of discussions.</p>\n<p>The format I came up based on “The Solutions Focus” is simple and has 3 steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The miracle question.</li>\n<li>Rate the present.</li>\n<li>Step up the game</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This format would be used during the meetings between the employee and a trusted facilitator, between the coached and the coach. The facilitator could be the direct manager, but it is not necessary. A manager could directly help in the last step by providing access to resources needed in the development of the employee, but if the facilitator is not the person’s manager, help can be requested from the manager later on, if required. The focus is on “trusted” in order to provide the most value, otherwise it is a waste of time, since the discussion would be superficial and would not have the impact it could have.</p>\n<p>First discussion is longer because it is setting the ground, while the follow-ups are building upon it. Here’s what each component is about:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1_the_miracle_question\" tabindex=\"-1\">1. The miracle question</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1_the_miracle_question\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “1. The miracle question”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It is easy to get stuck in what is not working or the negative. It’s good to acknowledge these and move on quickly to the positive. Or even better, to the ideal.</p>\n<p>A great way to do that is for the facilitator to ask “the miracle question”. It goes somewhat like this: “What if a miracle happens while you are sleeping during the night and the next day all your problems are gone? What would be the first things you would notice? How could you tell the miracle has happened?”</p>\n<p>The purpose of this question(s) is to step away from the current things that hold one back and focus on the perfect future. I took it further here and framed it that this perfect future can even be in a different company or field. Many people keep a job that they don’t like, while dreaming at becoming someone else in their free time. I find that there are always synergies between these personas and there can be things that could get the person further on both sides, even while doing a job they don’t like that much. Either way, it helps to have an honest conversation and you cannot do that without discussing the coached’s deepest ambitions.</p>\n<p>It is easy here to describe the perfect future in terms of what it isn’t wanted. This would turn again towards the problems, which is not constructive to focus on. The facilitator should try to steer the discussion towards what it IS wanted from the perfect future. In as many details as possible. The more details, the easier is for the coached to visualize it and find ways to materialize it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2_rate_the_present\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Rate the present</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2_rate_the_present\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “2. Rate the present”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>This step’s goal is to acknowledge that it is not all bad right now and try to identify the good things.</p>\n<p>The facilitator asks the coached to give a rating between 0 and 10 of the current state, where 10 is the perfect future described in the first step. Most people would give a rating somewhat close to the middle, I doubt anyone would say 0. If they do, they aren’t thinking deep enough, in most cases.</p>\n<p>Let’s say the coached rates the present to be a 6. Next step is for the facilitator to say: “I see you didn’t say 0, so there are things that you are currently doing towards your ideal future. What are those?”The result is a list of things we want to encourage the coached to do more of, but about that, in the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3_step_up_the_game\" tabindex=\"-1\">3. Step up the game</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3_step_up_the_game\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “3. Step up the game”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>To move things further, the final step is identifying what things the coached can start doing now to get them closer to their ideal. And sometimes it is overwhelming to focus directly on the final state, because the difference could be considerable. Which is why the facilitator frames it like this: “You mentioned that the present is a 6, what could you do to make it a 7 or a 8?” This makes the coached to try to imagine intermediary steps and goals, steps and goals that are more achievable on a short or medium term. The result is a list of actionable items.</p>\n<p>One thing to note here is that although the question is focused on the coached, they don’t have to achieve everything on their own. They can ask for help from a colleague, manager, friend, or whomever.</p>\n<p>Second, this is where the list made at the previous step comes in handy. That list is filled with things that they are already doing and could potentially help the person achieve their goals. It is not mandatory to use those, but I would be surprised if that list is not useful at this stage.</p>\n<p>Finally, the coach and coached agree for a follow-up meeting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"follow-up\" tabindex=\"-1\">Follow-up</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#follow-up\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Follow-up”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The follow-up meetings have the same structure, but there will be less time spent on each step. It is highly unlikely the perfect future to change radically in a few months. If it does, follow it through. Rating the present will give an indication if progress has been made. And stepping up the game will give the opportunity to review the previous action points and decide for the next ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"side_notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Side notes</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#side_notes\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Side notes”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It is ok for people to not have anything to improve. They can be in situations that doesn’t give them much mental power or energy to take things further. That is perfectly fine. There is a tendency to push for these actionable items at the end no matter what. That will not achieve anything. Which is why it is important for the coached to be in the driver’s seat. If they are in a position where they want and can take things further, then they can setup a meeting with a facilitator.</p>\n<p>I found many of these discussions energizing and the format simple enough, which maximize the impact of these kind of discussions.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>At the beginning of this year, I got a new hybrid bike (combo between speed and city bike). Without making any customizations other than adjusting my seat, I started riding it around the city, either to do the shopping or go to work in the center of Stockholm, and back home. Several months later, I had a small accident on my way home through the busy city center. No-one was hurt, except (my pride and) my front brake plate, which was bent from the impact with the bike in front.</p>\n<p>It was my fault mostly, I got distracted (which doesn't happen often) and also the flow of bicycles stopped abruptly because someone decided to not run a red light (wise choice!) like some of the people in front of them. So I didn't hit the brakes in time and the accident happen. The man in front of me (whom I hit) called me an idiot without even turning to me and started cykling further.</p>\n<p>At this point, you might start wondering where am I going with this story. Fair point. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>Now being close to the end of some of the financial years and before Black Friday and Christmas there is a rush 🚀 to do more, finish more, achieve more. I am sure you all feel it. At the same time, there's less sun light 🌃 here in the northern hemisphere of the globe, <a href=\"https://lmgtfy.app/?q=depression+is+on+the+rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depression is on the rise</a>, physical health issues (hello, winter viruses) are on the rise, maybe speeding up in our professional life is not the wisest thing to do right now.</p>\n<p>But if we do, we should make sure we have mechanisms in place to keep us safe from going too fast 🚤, too far.</p>\n<p>Going back to my bycicle story. When I was installing my new brakes, I learned also how to calibrate them to be snappier, to be a bit tighter, so I can hit the brakes faster and with bigger impact. I realized this way that previously my brakes were calibrated in such a way that it took quite a long time and effort to stop at higher speed. Which is great for beginners when you are taking it easy, but not so great when you increase the speed and you need to react faster. (It was still my fault for the accident, with or without snappy brakes)</p>\n<p>In the same way in our real lives, if we don't setup ways to keep us from over-working, especially when the world might not be the happiest place, we might reach places it will take a lot of effort to get back from. Usually, our body is pretty good at letting us know when we are pushing it too far, but in those moments, we should not ignore the issues and pump some pills just to get us to the next milestone. We should also hit the brakes. And when we do, those brakes should be well calibrated.</p>\n<p>P.S. Some other months later, I was riding to work in the morning and some tourists were riding some rented bikes recklessly. But this time, I saw them and was able to break switfly, just in time.</p>\n",

They also did not have twisted representations of Ops teams hidden under other roles. No, there would only be engineers of different specialties, working together in different teams in several departments. <em>None have DevOps in their titles, but they all know what it is all about.</em></p>\n<p>Each team owned a slice of a product (internal or external) that they took care of end-to-end, including operations. That doesn't mean they were isolated. They had dependencies on other teams, products and services.</p>\n<p>As the companies grew, supporting teams were created to take ownership of common concerns. These platform teams created products that abstracted most of the burden of the common concerns, while allowing product teams to be in full control of managing their slice of product. Product teams no longer did operations, deployments and others from scratch, but they made use of platforms that standardized and fulfilled these needs, while maintaining the product teams independence as much as possible. <strong>The ownership boundary was very clear</strong>, the last thing they wanted is to have an incident and not know who should be called to respond to it. Product team? Platform team? Both? <em>It's impossible for platform teams to be the first point of contact for all incidents.</em></p>\n<p>All of this impacted Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR), which in my dream it is a metric <a href=\"https://blog.last9.io/why-mttr-should-be-a-business-metric/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teams keep a close eye on</a> . They knew it is not as important to ship bug-free code to production, as is how fast you show up to fix problems in production. This doesn't mean they were sloppy on writing, testing, building, shipping code, but that they were maintaining a healthy balance between investing in writing the perfect code and making sure they have a top-notch incident response strategy.</p>\n<p>Actually, <strong>all elements in software development mattered, but none is more important than the end goal: to build great products.</strong> It's easy for some teams to take their mission to absurd and it's quite hard to find the right balance in context. But the latter is exactly what the companies managed to juggle with in my dream. It is not a competition to ship the best slice, it is a never-ending marathon to keep shipping the best product.</p>\n<p>And this is connected to another aspect from my dream: <strong>the company culture was to build in public</strong>, with goods and bads. There was no place for silos, public interest communication happening behind private messages and back doors. Almost all communication was done in public internal forums, where everyone could contribute or just read and move on to other things. They also set up things in such a way that it was easy to know where the right information can be found. These encouraged collaboration between teams and facilitated open discussions about everything. Again, balance was critical, owners took the decisions, but they chose to involve others and present their reasoning in public.</p>\n<p>There were many other things I wanted to dream about, but I had to wake up and start my day. What a dream! I wish it will someday come true! 😊</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb1BD77G7Mo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Building internal platforms does not represent a goal on its own. Building internal platforms makes sense only if it brings (indirect) value to the end users of the main products. And in order to do that, we need to know these products.</p>\n",

There was a clear need for their purpose and some team or individuals started one as an experiment. The experiment takes-off quickly and becomes permanent with many teams starting to depend on it. The platform gets its own team or teams and it gets used by more and more teams. This is the most common story I encountered and I would say quite a successful 🍾 one. But there is something that almost never gets prioritised until it is very late in these successful platforms: redistribution of costs towards the teams using the platforms or at least making them aware of the magnitude of the resources they are consuming while using the platform.</p>\n<p>In systems thinking this is a common pattern that is well-known. It is called &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When there is a commonly shared resource, every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the costs of its abuse with everyone else. Therefore, there is very weak feedback from the condition of the resource to the decisions of the resource users. The consequence is overuse of the resource, eroding it until it becomes unavailable to anyone. - <em>Thinking in Systems</em> by Donella Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've seen this in action several times and it is almost painful to experience it, especially as part of the platform team maintaining the platform. Users of the platform are not aware of the costs they are driving. Not having clear guidelines on how the platform should be used makes things even worse. It is very easy and natural for the platform to be used in wasteful way.</p>\n<p>There comes a critical point where the platform becomes quite expensive 💸 to run while many teams are depending on it. The platform team is pushed to drive the costs down fast, but without proper cost tracking per user group done by then, this becomes a painful exercise that hurts everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_solution💡\" tabindex=\"-1\">The solution💡</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_solution💡\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The solution💡”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource. And also restore or strengthen the missing feedback link, either by privatizing the resource so each user feels the direct consequences of its abuse or (since many resources cannot be privatized) by regulating the access of all users to the resource. - <em>Thinking in Systems</em> by Donella Meadows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some companies go as far as redirecting costs to each team using the platform, so the cost of each of the platforms a team is using is deducted from the team budget. But it's not necessary to go that far. It should be enough to make teams aware of their costs of using the platform and put it in perspective 📊. <em>How does it compare with other teams or maybe with a typical team with their needs?</em></p>\n<p><em>The goal</em> 🎯 is not to make the teams to stop using the platform. Quite the opposite actually. But we all know that we tend to be less careful with things we don't own or that we don't pay for.</p>\n<p><em>The goal</em> 🎯 is to make teams use the platform more effectively. This requires:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>good cost tracking mechanisms from the beginning,</li>\n<li>simple way to make teams aware of their costs and</li>\n<li>guidance and simple mechanisms for the teams to optimise the way they use the platform.</li>\n</ol>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>As companies grow, engineering teams start gathering more and more common layers in the company's product parts they own. So instead of each of them &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot;, internal platforms are created to encompass all the common layers or even to add new layers that serve specific purposes. It's quite common to have a &quot;monitoring&quot; platform, a &quot;deployment&quot; platform, a &quot;development environment&quot; platform, a &quot;log aggregation&quot; platform, a &quot;compliance&quot; platform and so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>These platforms are internal products whose users are other employees from the very same company. And yet, they are usually not being treated like a real product being offered to paying customers. Maybe because they are not really paying for it, but still I believe it is in the company's interest to treat these products like they would be released to external paying customers.</p>\n<p>Here are 3 common aspects where I found most internal products to be lacking:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1_knowing_your_users_is_crucial_❗\" tabindex=\"-1\">1. Knowing your users is crucial ❗</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1_knowing_your_users_is_crucial_❗\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “1. Knowing your users is crucial ❗”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In case of external products, there is no doubt that knowing the needs of these products' users and how they use the product is crucial. This impacts the decisions on how the product is developed, released, maintained but also how the company itself is being governed. Successful product =&gt; company growth, shitty product =&gt; company fail. Any amazing idea that is put into a product needs to be shaped by constant feedback from its users and from the reality of the context of the company behind it.</p>\n<p>An internal platform that is completely detached from its users needs is a failed product. Developing and maintaining it, but also making it mandatory to use are a huge drain of energy and money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2_product_managers_shape_the_products_💠\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Product managers shape the product(s) 💠</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2_product_managers_shape_the_products_💠\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “2. Product managers shape the product(s) 💠”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Product manager is a job position, in some places it is an actual job people do fulltime and in some companies it is an explicit role that people take. Regardless, they are the ones who drive the products further. They keep in touch with the users, they collect requirements from different sources and they distill all this in consistent product vision and roadmap.</p>\n<p>In the same way this is an important thing to have for an external product, it should be a mandatory position or role for internal products. In the case of the internal products, this position many times doesn't exist and the role is usually shared, but not even in an explicit way. The result is a Frankenstein (no offense intended Frankie!) of a product that nobody knows where it started from and where is it really going.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3_keep_users_in_the_loop_➿\" tabindex=\"-1\">3. Keep users in the loop ➿</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3_keep_users_in_the_loop_➿\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “3. Keep users in the loop ➿”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Most successful products have a lot of content available about them. There is documentation, there are blog posts announcing new features and how to use them, local events bringing their users in a certain location together and even large conferences dedicated to one single product. The purpose is to have the users informed and feel part of the development of the product, but also have them interact with the product company and form a community.</p>\n<p>Internal platform products might not have the same amount of users compared to external products or the same amount of people supporting them, but in large companies these numbers can be quite significant. Especially in the situations where a small number of people need to maintain and develop a platform that is used by hundreds of users, community is very important. And comunity is being built through multiple channels of communications with the users, be it blog posts, regular office hours where new features are introduced and questions are answered, workshops, events or seamless means for the community to contribute.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusion\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Conclusion”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It's quite easy to discount internal users' time and make them use poorly developed products. Their time does not have an explicit price tag and they are also not bringing any explicit income by using these platforms. Because these are very hard to track or measure, then they are also easy to neglect. But the benefits of these platforms are there, if they are executed in a good way.</p>\n<p>P.S.

Still, I found it useful to post here a selection of these to build a superficial picture of the author's perspective on the current state of the various types of formal education and its future. I recommend reading the whole book for a more in-depth view on the subject, but also on how to build and deliver a better learning experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_gist\" tabindex=\"-1\">The gist</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_gist\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The gist”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The current predominant type of education is ineffective and serves the wrong purpose. Education is no longer something you do mostly at the beginning of ones career, but it is a constant activity throughout the whole life. The current education institutions will most likely not be the ones delivering the education of the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"today\" tabindex=\"-1\">Today</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#today\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Today”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>current education is woefully out of step with the needs of the modern world in pretty much everything, from the curriculum itself, to the structure through which it is delivered, to the way it is packaged, to the incentives for changing and improving it (or not), to the outcomes that it does (or doesn’t!) deliver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We tend to forget that formal education was basically established as a buffer. This buffer would keep children out of the workforce but would—at the time—teach them as if they were already some kind of cog in an assembly line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Education, like the restaurant reviews, police officer’s uniform, and doctor’s lab coat, is a signal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The working world of the present and future is simply out of alignment with the substance that education once signified. Part of the reason is the lecture format that most colleges still employ, which isn’t an effective structure for most students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>lectures are among the least effective pedagogical devices known to man. That’s one of the biggest ironies: that most every class I’ve taken on “cutting-edge adult learning” has been taught using all the modalities (lectures, trivial homework, facile tests) that aren’t cutting-edge adult learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bryan Caplan, professor of economics at George Mason University, put it this way: ... Most of what schools teach has no value in the labor market. Students fail to learn most of what they’re taught. Adults forget most of what they learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest strike against higher education is its legacy of success, and the blindness that creates the need for change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"a_transformation\" tabindex=\"-1\">A transformation</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a_transformation\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “A transformation”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>if students don’t experience a real transformation, there’s no point to the education. Which is especially tough, because transformation for one person might not be transformation for another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For learning to be truly transformative, then, it has to be customized around the unique strengths and opportunities available to the learner in question. Which has the added benefit of being more engaging to the student, at a time when just holding a student’s attention is getting harder and harder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"not_just_knowledge_we_need_insight\" tabindex=\"-1\">Not just knowledge, we need insight</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#not_just_knowledge_we_need_insight\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Not just knowledge, we need insight”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>To succeed in the Age of Acceleration we need soft skills, and the intangible but critical things like work ethic and initiative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A glaring flaw of most current approaches to education is that they focus entirely on imparting knowledge or fostering proficiency in certain skills. The ability to develop insight is left unexamined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s no longer sufficient for education to impart knowledge and skills. Our rapidly evolving economy and culture demand insight in addition to knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight lives at the intersection of two rarefied abilities: critical thinking and creativity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what_is_the_future_of_education\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is the future of education?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what_is_the_future_of_education\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “What is the future of education?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>The way that education is being delivered is shifting from real-time to semi-synchronous, from just-in-case to just-in-time, from information to transformation, and from mandatory to volitional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the second major transition in the world of education: from just-in-case to just-in-time. Learning used to be something that you did for a long time at the start of your career, but that just doesn’t work in today’s world. It’s so much easier to access information and training when we need it, and conditions change so quickly that things you learned “just-in-case” are more likely than not to be outdated and irrelevant by the time you actually need them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The transition from just-in-case to just-in-time means that the only people with the expertise that students really need are the ones on the cutting edge of their industries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>not only is much of what we learn “just-in-case” as likely as not to be outdated by the time we need it, but also, as Rohit Bhargava elaborates in Always Eat Left Handed, the odds that we’ll need much of it are almost as slim as the odds that we’ll remember it if we do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most likely, education will divide into three categories: foundational, “last mile,” and continuing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Foundational education is the stuff that everybody needs: fundamental knowledge and skills, the ability to generate insight from whatever else you might learn, and the fortitude that is at the core of surviving and thriving in the world. This is what universities today say they do and even try to do, but fail miserably, in terms of both absolute results and return on the time and money invested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Last mile” education (hat tip to Ryan Craig, who coined the term) is the technical training that bridges the gap between a well-rounded foundation and the specific skills that are needed to enter specific career paths. This is currently offered in clunky fashion by law schools and medical schools, as well as by coding boot camps and apprenticeship programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Continuing education is what we all need in order to stay current in a world where “anything you learn is going to become obsolete within a decade.” Currently, this is a mess of executive education, learning on the job, self-study from books and YouTube videos, personal practice, certifications from a smattering of sources, and a variety of online courses from a range of providers, with little in the way of oversight or quality control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we can expect that in the not-too-distant future, a lifelong educational path will begin with one or two years of foundational and “last mile” education, either taken separately or bundled together, with four more years spread over the rest of our lives and careers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the long tail? This where the bulk of the education we consume over our lifetimes will come from—short and focused courses delivering just the information, insight, and fortitude that we need, just when we need it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>take away some choice, by bringing back start dates, end dates, and deadlines that must be met to remain a student in good standing. In other words, it’s dialing back from a-synchronous to semi-synchronous. This is a key factor why Seth Godin’s altMBA boasts completion rates of 96 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what Bhargava calls “light-speed learning.” In his words, “The road to mastery on any topic gets faster through the help of bite-sized learning modules that make education more time efficient, engaging, useful and fun.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"who_will_deliver_the_future_of_education\" tabindex=\"-1\">Who will deliver the future of education?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#who_will_deliver_the_future_of_education\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Who will deliver the future of education?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>If not colleges, who will provide the lifelong learning of the future? From the only place that it can come from: the experts and professionals on the cutting edge and front lines of their respective fields. They’re the only ones whose knowledge and skills will be sufficiently up to date to provide what learners will need.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Generally speaking, those people are gainfully employed at places other than universities. If they moved to full-time teaching positions, it would take only a few years for their expertise to start going out of date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>P. S.

More than that, from that moment on, Visual Studio Code behaves like it would be also running inside the container, so for example, if you would open a terminal inside vscode, the shell session would run inside the container.</p>\n<p>After installing the extension, vscode has some pre-defined containers we can choose for our development environment, but I chose to define one myself.</p>\n<p>Let's say I would like to work some more in <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/dragon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Rust project</a> I started some time ago.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/rust-dev-container.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I can open the project in vscode and in order to get started developing in a container, I need to create a special folder called <code>.devcontainer</code> and a <code>devcontainer.json</code>  file inside it.

This time, I will do it myself: <code>F1</code> and search for <code>Rebuild and Reopen in Container</code> option. Once the container is started and vscode started inside it, I can see written <code>Dev Container</code> in the bottom-left corner. More than that, if I open a new Terminal, I can see that the session in it runs as user <code>alex</code> and it has my preffered prompt and color theme, just as configured in the <code>basic</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/project-dev-palace-all/blob/main/basic/Dockerfile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dockerfile</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/rust-dev-container-2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And I am good to go.</p>\n<p>When I need to work with Kubernetes clusters, I create an empty folder where I just create the <code>.devcontainer</code> folder and the json file in it to run the <code>k8s</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/project-dev-palace-all/blob/main/k8s/Dockerfile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">container</a> and use the Terminal from vscode.

      "content_html": "<p>We are in a period of immense abundance of information, and yet, I think we are not taught how to learn in a proper way. The lecture-and-memorization-until-test is a poor-mans strategy at best. I also found out that most people I talked to don't really have a strategy for learning.</p>\n<p>The most common answers I got to the question &quot;How do you learn something new?&quot; were &quot;I read a book&quot;, &quot;I follow a course online&quot; or &quot;I watch YouTube&quot;. All of those answers are valid, but none of them represent a learning strategy. They represent sources of information and not how people actually learn from the content provided by the source of information, how we integrate new information and how we develop new skills, ideally for the long term and not just for passing a test.</p>\n<p>There are some techniques we can use to make learning more effective in a deliberate way. They are not obvious and usually counter-intuitive. They are collectively called &quot;desirable difficulties&quot;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what_are_desirable_difficulties\" tabindex=\"-1\">What are desirable difficulties?</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what_are_desirable_difficulties\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “What are desirable difficulties?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>Obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or better yet, watch the short video below where Dr. Robert Bjork (one of the cognitive psychologists that coined the term) explains himself what desirable difficulties are and gives some examples:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XPllm-gtrMM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Even ineffective learning can be hard and maybe not so pleasant, so I get it why when people hear that effective learning involves challenges and some frustration they are not quite jumping around with joy. All these techniques have been proven to work in many experiments and although they are not without challenges, you know they are worth it! 😊</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3 id=\"the_generation_effect\" tabindex=\"-1\">The generation effect</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_generation_effect\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The generation effect”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the techniques that I apply many times is called the &quot;generation effect&quot;. It is a very simple concept: whenever you struggle to find an answer to a problem on your own it will yield better, deeper, longer lasting learning. Even if the answer you found is wrong. So whenever someone is giving you a tip or directly the solution to a problem, they are helping you on the short-term, but they are also preventing you from learning more on the topic of the problem.</p>\n<p>In software development, it is rather common to find tips or solutions on Google or StackOverflow, which is jokingly called <em>copy/paste programming</em>. And it is completely fine for some tasks, but when approaching things this way, we are missing out on understanding the details about the solution. The details are very useful when we are interested in learning more about the technology or the area of the problem. The search for a solution might expose us to completely random things related to the problem. All of these help us deepen our understanding about the topic, learn more concepts that we might be able to apply in other problems we will encounter in the future.</p>\n<p>It’s much harder to find answers on our own, but it is very beneficial for our learning. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t benefit from the experience and knowledge of others, just that we should be mindful when it’s actually better for us to figure out things ourselves and when it doesn’t matter that much.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being forced to generate answers improves subsequent learning even if the generated answer is wrong. It can even help to be wildly wrong. Metcalfe and colleagues have repeatedly demonstrated a &quot;hypercorrection effect.&quot; The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer. Tolerating big mistakes can create the best learning opportunities. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3 id=\"spacing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Spacing</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#spacing\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Spacing”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is what it sounds like-leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. You might call it deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of trying to jam everything into our brains at once, we should plan our learning in spaced-out sessions. Maybe a day or several days apart, depending on our schedule and goals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Study-phase retrieval is based on the premise that retrieval benefits learning, and spaced learning opportunities are more likely than massed learning opportunities to involve retrieval of the previous learning experience. - Shana K. Carpenter, <a href=\"https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Distributed Practice or Spacing Effect</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In every study session, it is beneficial to repeat some of the concepts studied in previous study sessions, which represents the core idea of another desirable difficulty that I mention below, retrieval practice. And, actually, if we forget some of the things we learned in a previous session and we revisit them in a subsequent session, this actually increases the strength of learning those ideas or concepts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The important thing about spaced practice is that its effectiveness depends on the delay between the study session(s) and the final test or exam. - Yana Weinstein, Megan Sumeracki, Oliver Caviglioli, <em>Understanding How We Learn</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there is a test, then it should not be immediately after a session of study, ideally a day or two away.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More recent evidence suggests that spacing learning opportunities across different days may benefit memory due to sleep-dependent neural consolidation processes. -  Shana K. Carpenter, <a href=\"https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Distributed Practice or Spacing Effect</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Night sleep helps consolidate new things we learn during the day and when we study across several days, we give sleep the opportunity to work its magic on our memory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spacing may be effective in part because it increases what some researchers call “storage strength” – a measure of deep learning – rather than our current ability to produce information.  - Yana Weinstein, Megan Sumeracki, Oliver Caviglioli, <em>Understanding How We Learn</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3 id=\"interleaving\" tabindex=\"-1\">Interleaving</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#interleaving\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Interleaving”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, we could simply watch some movies or enjoy time-off with our family and friends between the learning sessions on a specific topic, or we could take the time to learn some more, but on a different topic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a study using college math problems, students who learned in  blocks-all examples of a particular type of problem at once-performed a lot worse come test time than students who studied the exact same problems but all mixed up. The blocked-practice students learned procedures for each type of problem through repetition. The mixed-practice students learned how to differentiate types of problems. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And when we mix topics, especially complementary topics, we might start seeing patterns that can be applied to those topics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3 id=\"retrieval_practice_or_testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Retrieval practice or testing</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#retrieval_practice_or_testing\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Retrieval practice or testing”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Retrieval practice involves reconstructing something you’ve learned in the past from memory, and thinking about it right now. In other words, a while after learning something by reading or hearing about it, if you bring the information to mind then you are practicing retrieval. - Yana Weinstein, Megan Sumeracki, Oliver Caviglioli, <em>Understanding How We Learn</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Testing is probably one of the most used desirable difficulty when studying for an exam, but there are some interesting details about it that maybe are not so well known.</p>\n<p>For example, when we test ourselves on some things we learned in the past and we try to bring those ideas back from memory, we are actually changing that memory, so they don't usually come out exactly as we have learned them in the beginning. But, at the same time, this process has been proven to make the memory more durable and more flexible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Retrieval practice, like spaced practice, tends to produce learning benefits after a delay. If the assessment test is happening immediately, then students tend to perform best on the test after they have repeatedly read the information compared to when they have practiced retrieval. - Yana Weinstein, Megan Sumeracki, Oliver Caviglioli, <em>Understanding How We Learn</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After how much time should the test be to benefit the most from retrieval practice is not clear in research. What is clear is that when the test is immediately after studying, students who used retrieval practice performed worse than the ones that just tried to assimilate as much information as possible in the time they had.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusions</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Conclusions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>\n<p>Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Desirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick and becomes durable. - David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Desirable difficulties are no silver bullets, but they are proven to help long-term retention of the things we want to learn.

      "title": "Writing as a way of thinking",
      "content_html": "<p>After so many years of almost not writing by hand at all, I have rediscovered it as a simple, cheap, distraction-free way of thinking.</p>\n<p>I get a lot of thoughts through my mind, just like anybody else. But few of these thoughts I explore further. Some are ideas of something interesting to try out, some are worries or negative thoughts. Some come and go, some stick around the back of my mind. Some I wish to pursue further, but find it hard to start, some I know from the start they are made to be forgotten.</p>\n<p>When I was doing some cleaning around my desk, I found an old <a href=\"https://www.parkerpen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parker</a> fountain pen and an empty <a href=\"https://www.clairefontaine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clairefontaine</a> notebook. And I suddenly got an idea: what if I tried to write down some of my ideas in a notebook and try to expand them a bit more on paper. See where that takes me.</p>\n<p>This was a very attractive proposition, for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like pens of any kind, but fountain pens have a certain allure for me. How that wet paint flows on the paper has a hypnotizing effect for me. I particularly like the pens that leave a lot of ink on paper when writing. When building a new habit, it's important to like at least some parts of the activity you want to constantly be doing.</li>\n<li>It's cheap and easily available to me, so if it doesn't work out, not a huge loss.</li>\n<li>It's distraction-free. Paper notebooks have no WiFi or apps and don't require anything else than something to write with. I tried a similar approach using a computer and I found it very hard to stay focused, it is very easy to get distracted by some notification or remember about something else to do.</li>\n<li>It's very portable. Not as portable as a phone, but not far from it. I can write almost anywhere.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I got started with writing pretty much anything. Either for journaling and examine some of my thoughts, either for what might become a blog post or simple exploration without a set purpose and constraints. I have filled a notebook in a week! And it went beyond my expectations. How come I didn't think of this earlier?</p>\n<p>Encouraged by this success, I decided to do some small investments to the setup. My old Parker pen wasn't that great and I started doing some research. Which led me to discover some awesome cheap pens from a Chinese brand called <a href=\"https://www.twsbi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TWSBI</a>. They are absolutely brilliant! Their focus is on function and price and not on looks. Exactly what I was searching for. They write great and they are easy to use, so I have about 4 of them. Why 4 you might ask?</p>\n<p>Well, right around this time I realized that in fountain pen world, there are tens of options of colors to choose from and not just black, blue black and a few others. How exciting! So I chose a few colors I found attractive to write with from a British ink producer called <a href=\"https://www.diamineinks.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diamine</a>. They are available in small bottles (great for trying out new colors without breaking the bank), easily available in Stockholm (<a href=\"https://penstore.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">penstore.se</a> delivers fast and has most of their colors) and they are cheap. Plus, they seem to work well with the TWSBI pens.</p>\n<p>I find this a very relaxing habit and in some cases it produces something worth exploring further or to publish in a blog post, just like this one!</p>\n<p>For blog posts, I usually leave them a bit before I transcribe them on the computer. This gives me some time to rethink them and already improve and edit them when they become digital.</p>\n<p>Who would've thought I would enjoy writing on paper so much? And the best part is that I have 0 (zero) expectations from it. It is what it is.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I am not a supporter of the &quot;finding your passion&quot; narrative, but I do think you need to enjoy some aspects of what you do as work. And it shouldn't be like junk food, a distraction from other parts of your life, because that is also harmful.</p>\n<p>I was lucky to be exposed as a small child to a world that I enjoyed exploring every day and that would also become a main part of my work, but not everyone is that lucky.</p>\n<p>It is pretty common for parents to push their children to study and begin working in a job or field that pays well and seems to have a promising future. The safety of having a well-paid job for as long as possible is an important aspect of being satisfied with your work, but not if you hate every second of it. That makes people focus more on the material side, to the disadvantage of the quality of work they are doing. And it doesn't make them happier.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the argument that you should choose a job based on how big of a return you might get on the investment of studying for it, is pretty poor. It is very hard to make a safe bet on this one, because everything changes so fast. Technology evolving, climate change, political events, can have an impact on how current professions might look like in the future, if they even exist at all.</p>\n<p>I am more inclined into towards building breadth in whatever field one chooses. Learn wide on a variety of topics and try not to specialize too much or for too long. Specialization is a bet that has small chances to pay out on a long term. Or even if one chooses to specialize, one should be curious and learn complementary things, to make it easier to re-specialize if the need demands it.</p>\n<p>So find something you somewhat enjoy doing, become good at it and then explore its neighboring professions or practices. Get good at them as well. Continue, rinse, repeat, revisit, never stop learning.</p>\n",

      "title": "What about hope?",
      "content_html": "<p>In general, I cannot describe myself as the most hopeful optimistic shiny happy person, so when I found out about a book specifically about hope, from the world leading scientist researching hope, I thought it would be interesting to read it. The book is called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Hope-Happen-Create-Yourself/dp/1451666233/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&quot;Making Hope Happen&quot;, by Shane J. Lopez</a> and this is what I found out from it:</p>\n<p>Hope is essentially a way to think about the future and there are 4 key beliefs that distinguish it from optimism or wishful thinking:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&quot;the future will be better than the present&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;I have the power to make it so&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;there are many paths to my goals&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;none of them is free of obstacles&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If when you imagine your future, you believe all these things, then you are a hopeful person.</p>\n<p>What distinguishes hope from wishful thinking is that hopeful people have a realistic view regarding the obstacles there might be in the paths towards their goals. Hopeful people are primed for action, wishful thinkers are unrealistic about what it takes to achieve something and might have a hard time taking even the first step.</p>\n<p>Even less so, optimism has no base on what the future might look like in reality. It is kind of an illusion that the future will be better without concern about any other details. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;positive expectation bias&quot;.</p>\n<p>It sounds like hope is a very powerful skill to have, especially in the dynamic times we live in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how_do_we_become_more_hopeful\" tabindex=\"-1\">How do we become more hopeful?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how_do_we_become_more_hopeful\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “How do we become more hopeful?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>From what I could get from the book, there isn't any step-by-step do-this-and-be-hopeful guide (surprise, surprise!!!), but there are some things that can encourage the behaviors that hope is built on.</p>\n<p>First, it pays off to have a vision and plan for the future. This could pull us forward, even when the present might not be great. The story we create in our mind about the future might be quite at odds with our previous experiences, but as we take small steps in our future direction, we free up energy from worrying.</p>\n<p>Then, it is really important to think of different ways of moving towards our goals, of finding different pathways. Plan B, plan C or even plan D can save us from quitting in face of obstacles. That means that we should also be realistic about what obstacles and challenges we might face. The more options we have, the better perspective we have of the future and we are more hopeful.</p>\n<p>When the present might be too much to feel hopeful about the future and how much agency we might have to make it happen, the author recommends to ask ourselves 2 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who makes us feel like we matter? By talking or spending time with them or thinking about them, might give us the energy and determination to move forward.</li>\n<li>What really matters to us? &quot;Whenever you recall what matters most to you, you reconnect with you and feel your own sense of identity and purpose, which can spark you to take hopeful action.&quot;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides helping us move forward in our life &quot;hope buffers well-being from the effects of negative life events, shielding us from adversity, protecting us from stress and sadness, and making room for happiness.&quot;</p>\n<p>Finally, hopeful people are attractive to us, because by just being around them, we might catch some of their positive energy and make us more hopeful ourselves.</p>\n<p>I have to say that before reading Shane J. Lopez' book, my picture about what hope is and how it can influence our life was blurry.</p>\n<p>Some days it might be more difficult to be hopeful, but I have a better idea of what I could try to do to bring the spark back and focus more on building my future, rather than worrying about it. I hope it will inspire you to do the same!</p>\n",

      "title": "5 Dysfunctions of a (Kubernetes) Platform Team",
      "content_html": "<p>I’ve been working in platform teams for the last few years and I noticed some patterns or maybe better called dysfunctions. Although I could easily come up with more than 5, I couldn’t resist to paraphrase Patrick Lencioni’s book title, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni-ebook/dp/B006960LQW/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team</a>. Also, in my case, all teams I’ve worked in were building a platform based on Kubernetes, but I think all these patterns are applicable to any kind of platform team.</p>\n<p>Note: by platform team I mean a team that is building some kind of internal platform that is being used by other teams of the same company. In most cases, the platform is standardizing and abstracting some common piece of concern for multiple teams in the organization.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"fire_fire_too_much_fire_🔥\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fire, fire, too much fire!!! 🔥</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#fire_fire_too_much_fire_🔥\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Fire, fire, too much fire!!! 🔥”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many platform teams are ending up in constant fire-fighting mode. I see this as being a result of bad prioritization of what should the team be focusing on.</p>\n<p>It is common to prioritize the shiny new features over consolidating previous work. That’s because new features are immediately visible to the platform users, while consolidation might not be right away. But lack of consolidation will in time make the platform unmanageable.</p>\n<p>Another cause of too much fire-fighting is the inability of saying no to feature requests that make little sense to the platform as a whole. For example, someone requests to have a Redis instance on your platform just because you have this cool platform that could run anything. Just because the platform can host a Redis instance, doesn’t mean it should. Once you include something in the platform, the team needs to manage it. They need to have proper knowledge and infrastructure in order to do that. Say yes too many times to requests like these for things that the team cannot properly own and you’ll be soon in trouble.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"planned_vs_unplanned_who’s_gonna_win\" tabindex=\"-1\">Planned vs unplanned.

Who’s gonna win?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A platform team generally has 2 types of work coming in: planned work, consisting of improvements, fixes and new features to the platform, and unplanned work, which includes support work and incident handling. These 2 streams of work need to be handled differently and without some discipline, it is very easy to become overwhelmed by the unplanned work (if the platform has production users).</p>\n<p>A platform needs to constantly balance both. You need to develop new features and you need to support your users and react to incidents, all the time.</p>\n<p>First represents work that you have chosen to do in order to get the platform forward. Second is work that shows up unexpectedly and you need to do in order to keep your current users happy. First is more suitable for working in iterations (but not only) with fixed goals in advance. Second is suitable for Kanban where you fix the available capacity and handle the constant flow of work with the capacity you have set, while doing continuous reprioritization as new work comes in. With the first type of work, you can set some kind of timeline where certain features can be expected to be completed. The second is a constant marathon that the team keeps on running as long as the platform exists.</p>\n<p>In some cases, unplanned work can generate items for the planned work. For example, if you notice a lot of support issues repeating over time, maybe it's better to automate them somehow or fix an underlying issue that is causing them, as part of planned work.</p>\n<p>Having fixed (less than your team size) capacity on unplanned work ensures that you have remaining capacity for planned work. There might be times when the team needs to temporarily increase the number of people working on support to handle some bigger and urgent issues, but most of the time unplanned work should be bound to its allocated capacity.</p>\n<p>Find a good cadence and capacity for the unplanned work and you are set for success. Let it run loose and constantly take over the whole team and you are doomed.</p>\n<p>Note: it might be tempting to split planned and unplanned work into different teams. Don’t! The unplanned work team (Ops?) will not be able to solve many issues without the help of the planned work team. The planned work team (Dev?) will develop the platform in a silo, away from its users and the issues they might have with the platform.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"users_need_to_use_our_platform_because_they_have_no_choice\" tabindex=\"-1\">Users need to use our platform, because they have no choice</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#users_need_to_use_our_platform_because_they_have_no_choice\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Users need to use our platform, because they have no choice”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Forcing a platform on other teams is a lost battle from the beginning. Forming a platform should happen because it can abstract and fulfill essential needs of other teams in the company, freeing some of their time to be spent on other things. It should not be done because of political or any other reasons that are not connected to supporting the needs of other teams in the organization.</p>\n<p>It’s incredible how quick companies are to force their employees to use a junk internal plaform with poor support. This would never fly with their external costumers (unless you are one of the giant tech companies who have a lot of leverage in the market).</p>\n<p>Internal platforms should be made very attractive, so they are the obvious choice. This further means that the features should be spot-on with the needs of the teams using the platform AND the platform team should have a service-minded attitude towards their users. A platform team who is actively engaging with its users and builds a community around its platform will have a much bigger positive impact on the organization with less effort.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"let’s_abstract_everything_😈\" tabindex=\"-1\">Let’s abstract everything!!! 😈</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#let’s_abstract_everything_😈\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Let’s abstract everything!!! 😈”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>An understandable pattern when forming a platform is to have a goal to abstract everything from the reach of its users. The invoked reason it to let the other teams focus on their business and not care about deployment or pipelines or whatever purpose the platform might have. That is a noble intent, but I think it is a mistake to do so in most cases.</p>\n<p>While there is room for many things to be abstracted and standardized when building a platform, it should leave its users in full control so they can be independent in managing their product, from commit to operations and monitoring in production. That is a difficult balance to find, but I think it makes a difference what is the intention of the platform. And then it is actually quite simple to know if the balance is off (although it might a bit late): when an incident happens in the product or service that is built on top of the platform, does it require input from someone from the platform team? If the platform team needs to answer to most of the incidents of their users products, then the balance is wrong.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"platform_instances_are_our_pets_and_we_want_them_to_live_forever\" tabindex=\"-1\">Platform instances are our pets and we want them to live forever</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#platform_instances_are_our_pets_and_we_want_them_to_live_forever\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Platform instances are our pets and we want them to live forever”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not my favorite metaphor with pets and cattle, but it is what it is. Bottom line is that we should invest in infrastructure-as-code and automation so we can easily recreate our platform instances. These can be Kubernetes clusters or bare virtual machines, it doesn’t matter. Being able to quickly recreate the platform instances whenever is needed has many advantages, just to mention 2 of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in case of an incident, the platform team can create new instances that would help restore the activity of the platform, while keeping the faulty instances for investigations. No more open-heart live fixes, while users shout that your service is down. You can take care of the emergency situation first and resume activity and investigate the issues later at leisure.</li>\n<li>simpler upgrade strategies: when you need to upgrade some essential piece of infrastructure of the platform just create new instances with the new versions, run tests, validate. If all is good, swap, destroy and move on!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And those are it, my 5 dysfunctions of a platform team! To the brave ones of you who made it until here, I salute you! 👋 What do you think? Do you recognize any of these?</p>\n",

It's like watching someone record a podcast. If you've got something to say to your team, record it. Put it on Vimeo, put it on YouTube. Instruct the people, because you have power and authority to watch it. Let them watch it sped up. Let them watch it twice. Let them watch when it works for their schedule. Let them watch it and discuss it with others. But why are we wasting the juicy magic of synchronized, real time experience so that you can be uncomfortable live in front of a bunch of people who are uncomfortable watching you pontificate? It doesn't make any sense at all. Why is it for a class room that's running on Zoom, to involve a teacher lecturing to the class for forty minutes, this makes absolutely no sense. Find one teacher, someone who's really good at it, and have them record the best forty minute lecture ever recorded, on the origins of the war of 1812, and then let everybody else watch it when they want it. The beauty of a Zoom call is not that it gives one person a chance to talk for a long time, because they have power. The beauty of it is, if we're going to do it in real time, let's make it a conversation. Let's have something going on that unfolds in a way that we cannot predict. Because if it's a memo, send a memo. Don't have the meeting. It's too expensive. It enervates us, it wipes out. We have wasted this chunk of time forcing things that should happen asynchronously into real time, just because it's convenient, just because it's become the standard. We have to stop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the <strong>Akimbo</strong> podcast, <em>Dancing with time</em> (link to episode on <a href=\"https://share.snipd.com/episode/e4867e6b-80a5-414a-9f50-6c790ff776db\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snipd</a>)</p>\n<p>Live lectures from company leaders don't make much sense for me, other than for entertainment reasons.

      "content_html": "<p>Maybe one of the most important things to figure out for kids over 7-8 months old, regardless of who takes care of the child, is a #routine that works and that you can keep consistently every day, including weekends.</p>\n<p>It may vary a little bit, but from what we've learned, the naps and meals should come pretty much all the same time and order every day.</p>\n<p>I don't know how it would be for other children, but for our daughter, if we disturb her routine or is she doesn't have her needs met, the end result will be that she will not sleep well during the night, which means that we don't sleep and it quickly becomes a disaster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"routine_what_is_a_routine\" tabindex=\"-1\">Routine?

What is a routine?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Well, what I mean by #routine, in this context, is a series of activities that start and end at a specific time of the day and in a specific order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timing_and_order\" tabindex=\"-1\">Timing and order</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#timing_and_order\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Timing and order”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Both the timing and the order of the activities are important and should be kept the same, because then the child gets used to schedule, internalises the order of events and they are more comfortable and less stressed. They even start anticipating what comes next.</p>\n<p>For example, our daughter starts laughing and waving goodbye to her mom when we finish breakfast, because she knows by now that our daily morning walk in the park is coming and mommy goes to work. Needless to say, this is not how it went the first few times we started doing this. 😅</p>\n<p>Another example is getting her used to fall asleep with me in the afternoon. Initially,  she would be more tense and fall asleep harder in my arms, but as time goes, she would get used to it and be more relaxed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consistency_consistency_consistency\" tabindex=\"-1\">Consistency, consistency, consistency?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#consistency_consistency_consistency\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Consistency, consistency, consistency?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Babies are humans also (shocking, right? 😄) and even with best routine and discipline some days might not work out as expected, and that is normal.</p>\n<p>Some days (or nights) might go completely crazy in unexpected ways, regardless of how well we did. That doesn't mean the routine is bad, it might simply mean that the baby was stressed by something. It's good to understand why, but it's good to avoid sudden changes.</p>\n<p>Like with any habit building process, it takes time to form a new habit, so we know we need to keep repeating it until it sticks!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how_to_come_up_with_the_routine\" tabindex=\"-1\">How to come up with THE routine?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how_to_come_up_with_the_routine\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “How to come up with THE routine?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I am no expert, but we got some advice from a pediatrician.</p>\n<p>Together with her, we started building the routine by looking at the schedule of the parents and plan in the naps and night sleep. Those need to be at maximum 4 hours apart, when having 2 day naps (based on the recommendation from <a href=\"https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/11-month-old-sleep-schedule-and-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huckleberry</a>, but we confirmed it on our own when we had to extend the wake time and sometimes that didn't go well). Then we added the meals and snacks. Combined all this with breastfeeding times based on my wife's work schedule (currently from home) and to maximise her continuous blocks of work as well.</p>\n<p>Food and sleep are the biggest elements of the routine and can be tricky to get them to be in harmony. But as with everything new and complex, it requires some trial-and-error to find the sweet spot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our_routine\" tabindex=\"-1\">Our routine</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#our_routine\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Our routine”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In case you are wondering what is our routine, here it is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wake up around 6-ish</li>\n<li>Breakfast at 7</li>\n<li>Leave for morning nap in the park at 8</li>\n<li>A snack around 10:30 or as soon as she wakes up</li>\n<li>Back home around 11</li>\n<li>Lunch around 12</li>\n<li>Afternoon nap around 14</li>\n<li>Snack around 15:30</li>\n<li>Play outside around 16:30</li>\n<li>Dinner around 18</li>\n<li>Night sleep around 19</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice the 'around' word I used everywhere. The length of the naps affects the exact times. If she sleeps less in the morning, then we slide everything earlier slightly so she doesn't stay awake more than 4 hours. She might actually compensate in the afternoon nap, but it's not necessary. No day is exactly the same, but each day offers a new opportunity to run the routine as planned.</p>\n<p>If there is a bigger gap in sleep (maybe she slept considerably less during the night) she might be more tired before the first nap, so she might even give signs she wants to sleep earlier than expected.</p>\n<p>Also, if the routine had been mostly consistent across several days, she might develop a tendency to want to sleep at the times she is used to, even though there are fluctuations in the schedule on a specific day.</p>\n<p>It sounds a bit complicated, because it is, so we try to simplify everything we notice we can or doesn't make a big difference.</p>\n<p>For example, initially we would meet in the park with my wife after the morning nap to breastfeed, but we noticed that our daughter doesn't need or want the breast then, so we skipped it! More time for work for mom and a simpler routine to follow. 🎉</p>\n",

When I write this, my daughter is about 11 months old and she has been on 2 naps for a while: a morning one and another one in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>When she would do the naps with her mom, she would lay in her arms and she would fall asleep accompanied by her best friend,  #theboob. For obvious reasons, I could not exactly do the same. It is also not recommended to try to do things exactly as the mother used to do it, because this might make the child believe you are replacing the mother and increase the separation anxiety which usually kicks in around this age.</p>\n<p>So here's the option that worked for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"welcome_to_my_morning_office\" tabindex=\"-1\">Welcome to my morning office</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#welcome_to_my_morning_office\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Welcome to my morning office”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/20210803_081126.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When she was very little, I used to take her for a nap in her trolley or on a carrier on me. As she has grown, the carrier can be less comfortable for the both of us, so the trolley seemed like a much better option.</p>\n<p>Put this option to test and with some trial and error, I managed to facilitate her morning nap in the trolley. She would sleep in it for anything between 40 minutes to 2 hours. <a href=\"https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/11-month-old-sleep-schedule-and-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The recommendation</a> is to sleep at least 60 minutes in each nap and no longer than 3 hours total duration of day naps.</p>\n<p>I would walk around with the trolley in parks around our home for about 3 hours and Stockholmers are very lucky to have plenty of green areas pretty much wherever you would live in or around the city.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i_would_walk_5000_miles\" tabindex=\"-1\">I would walk 5000 miles</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#i_would_walk_5000_miles\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “I would walk 5000 miles”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Even just the morning walk would send my step counter into a frenzy, so thought that maybe it would be good to find a different option for the afternoon nap.</p>\n<p>Remember what I said about not doing exactly what the mother would do? Well, I tried it anyway. And it failed miserably. I would hold her in my arms and sing to her and she would cry so hard that you would think I am torturing her (maybe I was, with my singing 😄). So I needed something else or I had to take a tour of the park in the afternoon as well.</p>\n<p>Someone told me about how their husband put their kids to sleep by waltzing with them in his arms. While waltzing or dancing is not really my strong suit, I thought it's worth a try. But I chose American Pie (the Don McLean version, of course) instead of a waltz. First time I played it on my phone low in the background until the rhythm starts faster and then turned it off. Finally, I dropped the music on the phone altogether and just sang the refrain on repeat while moving around the room in a sort of chaotic but gentle way. And it worked! She fell asleep in minutes! 🎉</p>\n<p>(On further reflection regarding the movement I do to help her fall asleep, I think the most it helps when gently swinging her sideways while she is in my arms, because this makes her eyes moving up and down, closing and opening and it helps her fall asleep.)</p>\n<p>But now comes the second part of the problem: I cannot hold her in my arms for 1.5 hours, not even for 30 minutes, she is growing and I am not very sporty, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>So after some attempts and a bit of waiting for her to go into deep sleep, I managed to lay down with her on me on a mattress. All good, but she didn't sleep too long in this position and she would have the tendency to try to get up in her sleep and cry...</p>\n<p>After several days of this routine, I noticed she is more relaxed with me so I thought to try to put her directly on the mattress next to me and surprise, although she moaned a bit, she continued sleeping, some day even for 2 hours (probably compensating for the shorter morning nap that day).</p>\n<p>And this is where I am at now. Next step is to put her into her bed instead, but every time I tried to do that she awoke and started crying, so I will be patient and go with this approach for a while before trying again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnings_tips_tools\" tabindex=\"-1\">Learnings, tips, tools</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#learnings_tips_tools\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Learnings, tips, tools”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><h3 id=\"1\" tabindex=\"-1\">1.</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “1.”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One of the most important things for getting this to work, was <strong>having a stable routine for the day</strong>, regardless if it's weekend or week day. That implies that I should not try to put her to sleep too early, but especially to not put her to sleep too late. Not more than 4 hours should pass between sleeps, because after that the child might get overtired and restless and frustrated because of that.</p>\n<p>It's good to do the same things before sleep. For example, I read to her the same book before the afternoon nap and I sing the same songs when I put her to sleep: <em>The Lion Sleeps Tonight</em> in the morning and <em>American Pie</em> in the afternoon. Interesting thing is that the moment I start singing she also starts making sounds and we read that this is how they help fall asleep themselves, so she knows that it is time to sleep, she anticipates it.</p>\n<p>I will dedicate a <a href=\"https://alexchiri.blog/2021-Aug-14-1520-the-routine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> on our daily #routine, it is very important in my view.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2\" tabindex=\"-1\">2.</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “2.”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>A very useful #tools for us to keep track of #sleep and not miss her optimal bed times is the <a href=\"https://huckleberrycare.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huckleberry app</a>.

Far from me to be able to say if that is wrong or right, I can only speak for myself and my wife.

Hypnobirthing consists in a series of practices, exercises and ways of thinking to prepare mothers for birth. These are best done with a partner who supports the mother through the whole journey. So actually it prepares the partner for this journey as well and they play an important part in it.</p>\n<p>When talking about ways of thinking, in Hypnobirthing an important one is that unless there are any medical issues, the mother's body knows best what to do during birth and mothers should listen to their instincts and be fully present. This means also that mothers should feel comfortable and safe with the people that are present at birth and with the location and atmosphere.</p>\n<p>There are also different practices and exercises that you do together with the partner and these have the purpose to build certain triggers and habits that the mother can use during birth to be more calm and present. You exercise having a state of calm and presence that you can bring back through the help of your partner when you need them. But you need to do the work and build those triggers so you can use them. Of course, the mother can learn these on her own, Katherine provides recordings and audio support in her training, but it doesn't compare with you, the dad, being that support.</p>\n<p>Another thing that KG Hypnobirthing provides you with is information. Lots and lots of information. About everything that happens before, during and after birth. It helps you decide, plan and document what you want and what you don't want to do during birth as a mother (or be done to you or your child). It is important to be informed and prepared for different scenarios. As we found out through our own experience, things might not go as you imagined. But you know you did your research, you prepared and you made a conscious decision. However the night goes (yeah, it will most likely be a night or afternoon, for some reason) you can be satisfied you did everything you could and maybe you can even enjoy it. 🙂</p>\n<p>Finally, besides the active support, the dad or partner makes sure that the decisions that have been made are followed at birth. The mother needs to be focused and should not be bothered with unimportant questions or stupid remarks. Dad can also take those.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a_life-changing_experience\" tabindex=\"-1\">A life-changing experience</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a_life-changing_experience\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “A life-changing experience”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It seems to me that a very common perspective regarding birth is that it is something you just get done with in order to get the desired end result: the baby.</p>\n<p>And until I learned more about births and how they can be and even watch some recordings of births (yep, done that too) I was minimizing the importance of this stage as well.</p>\n<p>There is also research that shows traumatic birth experiences have an impact on the baby for months or even years after! So it is not something to minimize or neglect.</p>\n<p>(I recommend reading the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Tantrums-What-Babies-Children/dp/0961307366/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tears and Tantrums</a> by Aletha Jauch Solter.

Although it didn't happened quite how we imagined it, I will never forget the moments I held my newborn daughter on my chest after she was born. She was so small and cute and alert and kept pulling my chest hair with her tiny fingers (ouch!). This and other precious moments from birth helped make the bond stronger between us. Not to mention the connection between the parents who share these experiences together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\" tabindex=\"-1\">Summary</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#summary\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Summary”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><ul>\n<li>I guess this turned out to be more of a post about how important I think it is for dads or partners to be present at their children's birth.</li>\n<li>Hypnobirthing was an important component for our well being during pregnancy and before, during and after the birth.

Am I a &quot;professional&quot;?</p>\n<p>While it seems that something being a profession is <a href=\"https://kenschwaber.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/software-development-a-profession/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more of a technicality than anything else</a>, being a professional is a bit more complicated and might have something more interesting to look into.</p>\n<p>These thoughts were not coming at this time out of complete vacuum. No, quite the opposite. I was reading <a href=\"https://www.sethgodin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seth Godin</a>'s new book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Shipping-Creative-Work-ebook/dp/B088QLT891/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Practice</a>. He talks in it about the difference between a professional, an amateur and a hack. Before I go any further, I will try to define these categories of people, based on the content of the book:</p>\n<p><strong>The professional</strong> always sticks to their commitments, even if they feel like it or not. They stick to their <em>practice</em>. Day by day they show up and deliver. While goals are important, they don't forget that being sensitive and empathic to what happens around them and keeping at bay the urge to control outcomes are important features of their craft.</p>\n<p><strong>The amateur</strong> shows up and does what they feel like it, when they feel like it. They are not consistent in their approach and in the results they deliver. Luck plays an important role in their perception of their approach. Amateurs can at first act as professionals, but they lack commitment and are prone to lose their way.</p>\n<p><strong>The hack</strong> does not care how the goal given to them is achieved and how the approach fits in the bigger picture, but they do deliver. Also not consistent in their approach, but you can rely that they will take the shortest path to achieve their goals, one way or the other.</p>\n<p>I can imagine most of us like to see ourselves as professionals in whatever we are doing. But are we, really?</p>\n<p>And does it matter? I think it does. Maybe on a short term the difference between the impact of the three categories is not great, but the focus should be on the long term. And honestly, there are situations when you'd be better off with a hack, but after that someone needs to clean up and put things into perspective.</p>\n",

In this post, I will show how I implemented it for my personal time and work-outside-of-work time using <a href=\"http://roamresearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roam Research</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of content describing how Roam works, so I won’t get into it much here, I do recommend to browse some of that content before continuing with the next parts of this post (see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkEMSGpD5zA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video 1</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_7_8AAkV7M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video 2</a>, for example).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what_do_i_need\" tabindex=\"-1\">What do I need?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what_do_i_need\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “What do I need?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Let me start off by enumerating the features I thought are needed for implementing CNAPA. I need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some sort of inbox where I can quickly and simply capture all the ideas and obligations that come my way 24/7</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A way to group these by role and status</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A way to visualize them per group and status (preferably ordered somehow)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some mechanism to define time blocks in my schedule and schedule items per block</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"capture_-_the_inbox\" tabindex=\"-1\">Capture - the inbox</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#capture_-_the_inbox\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Capture - the inbox”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>To fulfill the first step of CNAPA, I need some sort of mechanism to capture any kind of obligation, idea, thought that I would need to process later, a place where I can quickly dump anything that goes through my mind which is not useful to what I am doing at that specific moment in time. It needs to be simple to use and available to me at any time during the day.</p>\n<p>Roam has a feature called Daily Notes, a new page is created for you for each day and these are displayed when you go to the homepage of your Roam database. I think this is one of the most used features of Roam, many people put a lot of content directly in these daily pages. This content can be tagged so it can be referenced from other pages and you get the benefit of having a date associated to whatever content you put there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/capture-inbox.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Long story short, I use the Daily Notes as my Inbox. Whenever there is something I want to write down for later, I open my phone or my computer, go to Roam and put it down in the page of that day. I might tag or I might not, but if it’s something I need to act on sometime in the future, I will mark it as a TODO.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configure_-_group_visualize_clarify\" tabindex=\"-1\">Configure - group, visualize, clarify</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#configure_-_group_visualize_clarify\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Configure - group, visualize, clarify”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><h3 id=\"group_in_categories\" tabindex=\"-1\">Group in categories</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#group_in_categories\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Group in categories”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>For the purpose of this article, I chose to exemplify this process using three categories of items, or roles as Cal calls them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading - what do I plan to read in the future</li>\n<li>Writing - all kind of tasks related to my writing</li>\n<li>Home - whatever chores I need to solve around the house</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Normally, one might have several more of these, but to keep things simple, I stopped at three.</p>\n<p>If I’m not in a hurry, I would already tag the items with one (or more) of these categories when I capture them. Otherwise, I look at all my unresolved TODO items once a week and I assign them to the right category. It is very simple to do this with Roam: I go to my TODO page and I filter out all items that are queries (more on this in a bit) and all that are tagged with Reading, Writing and Home. All the items that remain should be the ones I need to assign a category to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/configure-group.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"group_by_status\" tabindex=\"-1\">Group by status</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#group_by_status\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Group by status”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Next, I need to further classify the items and give them a status or a bucket. This helps on setting a priority for each item, which in turn makes it easy to decide which item should I pick up next from each category.</p>\n<p>Again, just for the purpose of this exercise, I will use the following statuses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Important - for items that are important to complete</li>\n<li>Urgent - for items that need to be completed very soon</li>\n<li>Waiting to hear back - items where I cannot do anything until I hear back from someone else</li>\n<li>Nice to have - not important, not urgent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, Cal mentioned having a “Needs clarification” status and a “Backburner” status, but it really depends on your own needs. I suggest starting with a few and add/remove as needed.</p>\n<p>For both categories and statuses, I use tags in Roam (a tag is just like a page, it’s just displayed differently).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/configure-group-status.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"visualize\" tabindex=\"-1\">Visualize</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#visualize\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Visualize”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>At this stage, I find it useful to be able to have a look at all my open items grouped by category and status. The best way I found to do this in Roam is using tables and queries.</p>\n<p>In Roam, you can create tables using <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/pCJW4jhe-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a special command</a> and the rows and columns come from blocks indented under the table block. Queries are a way to filter through all the blocks you have in your database and display the results in a block. You can write queries using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJZBGJOzhUY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a special syntax</a> in Roam.</p>\n<p>I combine these two and I have a page where I created a table for each category and each table has one column for each status. Each table has only one row and in each cell, I put the results of the query for a specific category and status. This allows me to easily visualize in one page all the items I have for each category and status. I can also update them on the spot in the table, without having to go to where the actual item is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/visualize.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"clarify\" tabindex=\"-1\">Clarify</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#clarify\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Clarify”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Finally, in this step, I take a look at the items I have and see if there are older items that can be removed, or ones that can be combined, maybe some can be updated with extra details I found out in the meantime. This usually doesn’t take long if I do it weekly and it’s more of a quality of life activity, rather than an essential thing to do in this process. It brings benefits if you do it regularly, as you clean the weeds from your mental garden of tasks, but it can be skipped every once in a while, if you’re pressed by time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"control_-_plan_block_schedule\" tabindex=\"-1\">Control - plan, block, schedule</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#control_-_plan_block_schedule\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Control - plan, block, schedule”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><h3 id=\"plan\" tabindex=\"-1\">Plan</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#plan\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Plan”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Now that we know all that is on our plate, we need to plan some of that for the next period. It’s good to have a look at one week, or a month or more in advance, on a high level, the further you go in the future, the rougher the plan is. To make this easy, I usually share my personal calendar with my work calendar, this is rather <a href=\"https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">simple to do with Google accounts</a>. Then, I can see how my personal and work calendar looks like combined, in one view. With this view, I can visualize what empty spots are there in my calendar in my following week or weeks.</p>\n<p>Next, I look at what are the most important and urgent things I want to achieve on a given period of time (I usually do this for a week ahead) and decide how many blocks of time I want do dedicate to what category of items.</p>\n<h3 id=\"block\" tabindex=\"-1\">Block</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#block\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Block”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The idea with blocks is to create the opportunity to work on specific categories of things and not leave it to chance or if “I feel like it”. I define these blocks in advance, based on what I plan to achieve.</p>\n<p>With the calendar view in front of me, I create blocks in my calendar, where there are empty spots, and I name them according to the category of items they are dedicated for.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/block.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"schedule\" tabindex=\"-1\">Schedule</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#schedule\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Schedule”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>With the blocks in place, I can start associating items to blocks. If I plan multiple blocks of the same type in the same week, I usually schedule just for the first one because many times the items take more than the length of one block, so the item spills over to the next block from the same category.</p>\n<p>I also use Roam to associate TODO items with blocks. I have a small Python script that I run every time I do Configure and Control (weekly) and this script generates a small template with the number of the week and a block for each day under. I generate this every week and I paste it in a page I created in Roam called Schedule.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/schedule.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Under each day, I create a bullet for each block type I created for that day in the calendar. To schedule an item in a time block, I copy a reference to the TODO item in Roam and I paste it under the block I want to schedule it. This creates a reference and not a copy to the TODO item, so if I change it, it gets updated everywhere and I can navigate easily to the original item. Besides that, I tag the item with #Scheduled, so I know that item is already scheduled.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/schedule2.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Because every day in the Schedule page is a Roam page link, it will show in the Daily Notes page for that day. When I visit my Roam homepage, I will be able to easily see what blocks I have scheduled and what items for each. I still need the calendar to see at what time the blocks are scheduled, and then I have Roam to tell me what I scheduled.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/schedule3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When I complete a TODO item, I just mark it as DONE in the Daily Notes view and it gets automatically set to DONE everywhere. It will also disappear from my visualization of all items in all categories and statuses since the queries are searching only for open TODOs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/schedule4.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Configure, combined with some steps from Control, is something I do regularly once a week. Initially, I was doing this every Sunday, but I found it works better for me to take this time on a new week on Monday morning. Especially since I became better at it and it took less time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusions</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Conclusions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It looks complicated, but I assure you, it is easier than it seems. Once you go through the process a few times, it becomes second nature. It takes more time in the beginning, especially while you figure things out.</p>\n<p>It’s also a process that works well for me, but I didn’t come up with it at once. I started with just defining the TODOs and then I thought of the Schedule page and the Planning Overview and did a few adjustments here and there all the time. Initially, I used a physical whiteboard for the blocks and I would put post-its on it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the process I will have in 6 months from now will be slightly different than the one I described here in this post. The key is to start somewhere, think of what should the process help you do, find how to do it in whatever tool(s) you are comfortable with and keep on iterating on it.</p>\n<p>The 2-way links and block references in Roam make it quite easy to implement this process in it. But with some more manual steps, this shouldn’t be difficult to do in any tool. Since some might find useful to apply this in a professional context and Roam is not that common in companies (so far), I will try to implement it with tools more widely used. But that is the content of a future post.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this useful and I look forward for your thoughts and feedback! Is this something you would use in your daily work? Do you already do something similar today? Or if the whole process seems too heavy for you, what is one thing you could apply right away?</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://alexchiri.blog/posts/2020-07-12-healthy-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous post</a>, I described how I started re-introducing some of the healthy habits that kept me going before the COVID-19 madness. That already improved my mental and physical state. But I felt that I am still wasting a lot of time in meaningless things, like social media or worrying and being annoyed that I am not accomplishing as much as I wanted in different areas of my life.</p>\n<p>While brainstorming about how to change this, I remembered about <a href=\"http://www.calnewport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cal Newport</a> and his approach to structure his days using blocks of time that he reserves to specific tasks or purposes. All of his work or productive time is scheduled and dedicated to accomplishing something specific, as a way of making more opportunities for <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deep work</a>. I remember giving it a try in the past, but with this occasion I revisited his work to see if there is something I can do differently or if he came up with more ideas on this topic.</p>\n<p>Cal is now recording a <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">podcast</a> as well and he talks about his approach in some of the episodes he released so far (see <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+b1V0pKUQw/25:53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+b1V2Hxy4A/22:13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+b1V1zrl10/13:09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3</a>). Listening to these recordings inspired me to give it another try, armed with new ideas and tools. In this post I will describe his way (as I understood it) of managing his time and obligations to maximize effectiveness and to facilitate as many opportunities as possible to do deep meaningful work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_way\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Way</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_way\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The Way”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I found multiple issues with how I spent my time on things during the last few months. First, I tended to focus on one thing or another, without having a big picture of everything I should do and how important and urgent are each of them compared to others. Second, I tended to spend too much time on non-important stuff to fill-in the holes in my schedule. While some of these activities can be useful, I was also getting caught in all kind of stupid rabbit holes (very common with social media) that would leave me empty and frustrated by “the current world state”.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I consider myself a pretty organized person, always striving to do my work well, be on time and manage well expectations others have on me. But that doesn’t mean I am doing what is the most important for me and others in the most effective way. I needed some other way to visualize and organize everything I do. Here comes what I will call <em>Cal Newport’s Approach to Productivity and Accomplishment</em> (CNAPA, in short), my term, not Cal’s, and hopefully he will not hold it against me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_3_cs\" tabindex=\"-1\">The 3 Cs</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_3_cs\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The 3 Cs”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>CNAPA is inspired from <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen, with some quirks and simplifications (or at least that’s how I perceive it). According to Cal, in order to go from non-productive to productive, you need to do three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Capture</li>\n<li>Configure (similar to the Clarify, Organize and Reflect stages combined from GTD)</li>\n<li>Control</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"capture\" tabindex=\"-1\">Capture</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#capture\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Capture”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One essential step is to never try to hold things in our mind that are not useful to what we are doing, so we should have an easy way to capture all kind of thoughts, ideas, todos that come to our mind, in whatever moment of our day, and transfer them on paper or digitally. This way, we free our mind to be busy with other things and we get rid of that annoying feeling of loss when I get an idea, I try to remember it, only to get distracted, lose it and spend minutes or hours thinking about it and trying to remember what it was.</p>\n<p>Cal has a notebook always with him that he synchronises at the end of the day with his master list, which is a bullet list in <a href=\"https://workflowy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workflowy</a>.</p>\n<p>Successfully transferring all these thoughts immediately on some other medium, I get them off my mind, knowing that I can review them whenever I want or need them. And it’s important to review them, otherwise I captured them for nothing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Configure</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#configure\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Configure”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>As the capture list will only get bigger and most likely the items there won’t take care of themselves, I need to review this list periodically. How often depends on everyone’s needs. Also, if there are small things I can do right away without taking much time, then I should do them and get rid of them on the list. In GTD, anything that takes less than 2 minutes should be done straight away.</p>\n<p>During this stage, we should take the time to remove things that don’t make sense anymore, we should combine items that go together and split things further, if we decide it’s useful. Like pruning a bonsai, this is something we must do periodically, as our context changes, so do our requirements on what we need to do.</p>\n<p>When he reviews his list, Cal first reorganizes the items there based on which of his roles do they apply to (professor, writer etc) and this is an extra step from what GTD advises. Cal considers that this extra classification gives even more clarity on what’s on one’s plate and helps further control how we spend our time and direct our efforts.</p>\n<p>For each role, the items then are put in different buckets, based on their status. For example, is the task something that needs to be followed up on, or is something that can wait and be put on the backburner? Is it urgent? Is it something that needs to be further elaborated before it is actionable? Again, all this makes it easier to decide later on what is the one thing I should work on now? Also, these should be visualized in some kind of dashboard, for each role, items divided by status.</p>\n<p>Cal has a separate <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello</a> board for each of his roles, with each item being a card that is placed in a column corresponding to its status. With all these periodically reviewed and updated, we can have better control on what we spend our time on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"control\" tabindex=\"-1\">Control</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#control\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Control”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In the third stage of CNAPA, we take control of our time. I look at my schedule ahead and see what time I have available between my already set engagements. The idea is to give every available timeslot a purpose. So wherever I have some time in my schedule that is not promised otherwise, I reserve that block of time and I dedicate it to an item from my lists of items. Essentially, I ask and answer 2 questions over and over again: “What time do I have available?” and “What do I want to do with it?”.</p>\n<p>Based on personal needs, one can do this every day, every week, every month or every quarter. Typically, the further I look into the future, the harder is to schedule these blocks, since usually other obligations arrive and take priority. Cal mentions in his podcast that initially it will be hard to fit an item perfectly in the block of time available, but this improves with practice.</p>\n<p>I chose to take a slightly different approach here. Instead of assigning a block of time to a specific item from my lists of obligations, I assign blocks to one of my roles and groups of items I have and relatively shortly before the time of the block comes I select a specific item, whichever I consider it has the highest priority. I might finish that item or I might not. When the next block of that type comes, I might continue working on that item, if it’s still the most important and urgent, or work on something else. Basically, I see the blocks of time I put in my schedule as slots of time dedicated to a specific category of tasks, when I make progress on that specific area of my work by working on the different items and obligations I need to do in order to advance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rinse_and_repeat\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rinse and repeat</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#rinse_and_repeat\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Rinse and repeat”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I capture all the time, right away when something comes into my mind that I think it’s worth remembering (that extends to simple notes I need to remember, not just things I need to do, but that is a different discussion).</p>\n<p>I do configure and control once a week, typically on Sunday (I have a time block for this), sometimes I adjust during the week as well, but no major changes. If possible, I try to reserve blocks of time around the same time and days, this way I get used to it and it becomes natural, I don’t even have to check the block planning: it’s Wednesday, 15:00, time to work on my writing.</p>\n<p>It also happens that I have to move or cancel a block, because something more important comes up. That is totally fine. At that point, I have a look at my global overview of items and decide if I need to create somehow an extra block to compensate.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done this for many weeks now, but I get better at it week by week and I find more and more angles where I can improve things. But most important, I give myself the opportunity of working on all the things that matter to me. I have an overview of everything that needs to be done, it is outside my mind and I intentionally reserve time for each area of my life that I want to dedicate my attention to.

      "title": "Healthy habits",
      "content_html": "<p>The transition to working from home here in Sweden was sudden like everywhere else, little earlier than in other places and the measures towards COVID-19 notoriously mild. Still, my daily routine was turned upside down. I was quite euphoric towards the idea of working remote 100% for the time of the epidemic and annoyed by the general state of denial of people at large, denial that this will be the new order for a while. Even with all the stuff I read about working remote before the pandemic, I underestimated how much things would change and how long it would take me to adjust (still working on it).</p>\n<p>The general state of confusion, lack of quality information about what is going on and what is the perspective for the future are stress factors that can numb you and make time pass without noticing, you enter a state of low entropy as described in this beautiful short writing. Time passes fast, an endless repetition of the same events, purpose can slip away.</p>\n<p>I realized after about 2 months in this state that I pretty much dropped most of my daily habits that kept me in decent shape physically and mentally. I was not exercising, I was not reading any meaningful stuff, I was not listening to any podcasts and still seemed like I have no time.</p>\n<p>In comparison, “before”, I was doing a 10 minute meditation every day, running 7 km once a week and going to an intense Power Yoga class about 3 times a week, listening 3-4 podcasts per week and reading 2-3 books per month. All of these stopped, I was still reading, but mostly fiction. A distraction among others.</p>\n<p>So, I was mostly distracting myself, without putting much effort into restoring somehow the activities that gave me energy and kept me healthy. Truth is that all these activities were based on habits that I developed in time. And all of them had really good triggers - they initiate you to do something habitually. Most of the triggers went away when working from home and I made no effort of reprogramming them. I was gaining weight, not feeling that energetic and with a mostly pessimistic demeanour. All of this, while having everything I could wish for, really. What reason could I have to lose sight of what is important so easily? Truth is, none.</p>\n<p>But I decided to change that and here’s what I’ve done so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"action\" tabindex=\"-1\">Action!</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#action\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Action!”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><h3 id=\"restored_habit_1_daily_meditation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Restored habit 1: daily meditation</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#restored_habit_1_daily_meditation\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Restored habit 1: daily meditation”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I wrote about [[2017-03-25-habits-and-every-day-work|forming habits]] in the past and I find them extremely important for being able to be effective in anything. The trigger of a habit can be vital and in many cases it’s what makes the difference between doing something or not. Some triggers can be natural (for example, waking up) and some are artificial (like a calendar reminder). Both can have ups and downs. For example, using the moment you wake up as a trigger to do your daily meditation can be very convenient, since you wake up every day (ideally). The downside is that it is based on a mental agreement you set with yourself to do something when you wake up, there is no reminder or anything that tells you “MEDITATE NOW!”, so it can be weaker sometimes, but it is reliable, it is independent from time and it depends on a natural event that occurs with the frequency I wish for my developing habit. To help even further to have the habit to happen, I would prepare things in advance so it is super easy to get started with your habit when the time comes, maybe prepare the cushion in place before going to sleep, together with a timer or headphones or whatever I used for the meditation. This was a habit it was super easy for me to pick up again, I’ve been wondering why I dropped it in the first place, but that requires some more… uhm… meditation. I wrote [[2018-12-16-on-meditation-and-journaling|here]] about what I found meditation useful for after practicing the lazy-version-app-powered meditation daily for several months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restored_habit_2_jogging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Restored habit 2: jogging</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#restored_habit_2_jogging\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Restored habit 2: jogging”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The next habit I wanted to bring back is running outside the house and ramp up the distance gradually as I get back in shape. I’m not fond of running, I hate the starting part when you get into rhythm and try to regulate your breathing to keep up with the pace (or the other way around). But the feeling after is amazing, I have no idea how it is to be on drugs, but I assume it is comparable, minus the bad parts. On top of that, I can listen to podcasts while running. To top things up even more, I ordered some new headphones for running, some that don’t fall off when sweating like crazy. If it’s not clear what I was doing here, was that I am building my motivation to get this started, since this is not exactly a pleasant activity to me, but it keeps me healthy. Combined with several rewards that I setup and remind myself of (new headphones, memory of pleasant feeling after, opportunity to listen to podcasts) half of the work is done! Now to build a trigger. Since my schedule was hectic (almost an excuse), I left my trigger rather flexible, which is not always a clever idea. But <strong>if you set yourself too strict rules and you for some reason break them repeatedly, then the trigger will most likely stop working.</strong> Set it too flexible, then it might be too easy to ignore. In this case, I was really looking forward to trying the new headphones and listening to some podcasts from my queue, so I went for a milder trigger: I created 2 tasks for running in my weekly schedule, that I had to do somewhere during the week. At the beginning of the week, I am setting a day and time for these, based on how my calendar looks like and then I stick to those. That worked well, this was a successful attempt at baiting myself to do stuff! I could’ve went for a more definite approach and say I run every Wednesday and Friday morning at 8am, but since my work schedule had some unpredictable appointments in some weeks, I preferred the more flexible approach so I don’t make a commitment and then have to double down on it. Two habits restored, one more to go!</p>\n<h3 id=\"restored_habit_3_yoga_practice\" tabindex=\"-1\">Restored habit 3: Yoga practice</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#restored_habit_3_yoga_practice\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Restored habit 3: Yoga practice”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The one habit that helped me push through dark stressful winter days and make me lose weight as a bonus was practicing Yoga several times a week. This is not the typical relaxed Yoga I’m talking about, but what is called “The Rocket”, a style of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga created by a Yoga teacher who was also the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Schultz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal Yoga instructor</a> of the Grateful Dead rock band. It is very intense physically and sweat is guaranteed. What is also guaranteed is the amazing relaxed feeling after (at least in my case). Regardless how busy my brain was before the practice, regardless how much nonsense I accumulated during the day, at the end of the session my mind was empty, I was relaxed and with a general feeling of good. In non-COVID times, this would be something I would do together with my wife after work, at a gym close to our offices and it would have a definite start and end time. Plus, this was something we could enjoy and do together. During COVID times, this was out of discussion, for obvious reasons. So with all the triggers gone and all the other things going on, this was rather easy to stop doing. Picking this up again was very similar to running: I found an old audio recording of a class of our Yoga instructor, I created 2 weekly tasks and made a commitment at the beginning of the week to when I would be practicing in our living room. Also, this was an opportunity to test how well do my new headphones endure even more sweat! It’s not as fun as being part of a group and do this together, but you still get most of the benefits, and this is what matters!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what_next\" tabindex=\"-1\">What next?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what_next\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “What next?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>What will it be next? Well, consistency is key. I need to stick to these for a while before they become ingrained in my schedule. Summer is rather a different kind of time here in Sweden, where I have more control over my schedule, but I expect this to change once the autumn starts. I expect to keep adjusting these habits based on what happens in my life. As long as I don’t lose focus and I welcome change, I know from previous experience that I can stick to these for a long time. At some point they become second nature, until they need to be adjusted, then another accommodation period comes and so on.</p>\n<p>Talking about focus, I am a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cal Newport</a> and his work on <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deep Work</a>. There are a few practices he advocates that I want to pick up to further improve my productivity and be more resilient to the changes around me. But more about that in a next post!</p>\n",

I found more useful to answer &quot;Why is (there) Kubernetes?&quot;, to paraphrase the original question. &quot;Why&quot; is easier to explain than &quot;what&quot; because you don't have to go too deep in the technical details and there's an added bonus of explaining the purpose of Kubernetes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remember_when_everyone_was_satisfied_with_developing_these_big_monolothic_services\" tabindex=\"-1\">&quot;Remember when everyone was satisfied with developing these big monolothic services?&quot;</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#remember_when_everyone_was_satisfied_with_developing_these_big_monolothic_services\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “&quot;Remember when everyone was satisfied with developing these big monolothic services?&quot;”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Everyone used to deploy monoliths by logging in on the production VM or physical machine, configuring it, installing the dependencies and then starting the binary of the service or application. Which meant that the environments were not quite the same (if there even were multiple environments). This made reproducing issues and software development and deployment a quite nasty affair.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lo_and_behold_theres_docker\" tabindex=\"-1\">&quot;Lo and behold, there's Docker!&quot;</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#lo_and_behold_theres_docker\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “&quot;Lo and behold, there's Docker!&quot;”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Docker came and tried to simplify this and once you dockerized your application or service, you could easily run it on your local or test or staging or production environment more or less the same way. It was encapsulated in a container and all the dependencies came installed with it. You installed Docker on the hosts and you're good to go. Wanted to deploy a new version? Then you flipped the containers and it's done!</p>\n<h3 id=\"no_no_no_microservices_are_the_right_way_to_build_your_services\" tabindex=\"-1\">&quot;No, no, no, microservices are the right way to build your services!&quot;</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#no_no_no_microservices_are_the_right_way_to_build_your_services\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “&quot;No, no, no, microservices are the right way to build your services!&quot;”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Then the idea of microservices gained a lot of traction, which meant that instead of building this huge monolith service that does everything, you would build several smaller and somewhat independent ones. As a result, instead of having to take care of 1 or 2 Docker containers, you ended up with tens of them. Managing the loads on each of them and handling deployments in the &quot;traditional way&quot; became quite complicated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"and_thats_where_kubernetes_comes_in\" tabindex=\"-1\">And that's where Kubernetes comes in</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#and_thats_where_kubernetes_comes_in\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “And that's where Kubernetes comes in”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Kubernetes handles how your Docker containers are run on the machines. You give it a bunch of nodes where it can deploy services, you tell it how many instances of each of your services you want running and it takes care of the rest. Provided it has enough resources it will make sure to fulfill the desired state of your services.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there's much more to this subject and Kubernetes is not a magical tool that solves all the problems and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvEwPLcLcA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not everyone should go Kubernetes</a>. It's a complex tool that tries to solve specific problems and while doing that it might generate others. Instead of being busy with flipping containers on VMs, you can look at service meshes and how to shape the traffic between your services in a more effective way.</p>\n<p>And then again, you could also avoid adding all this extra complexity into your work and use a monolith architecture, <a href=\"https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">if it makes sense</a>.</p>\n",

      "title": "Make your own podcast transcription service",
      "content_html": "<p>There are a lot of very interesting podcasts out there that I like to listen to, as much as time allows me to do so. But I noticed that I don't recall much out of them and I feel the need to go through them again. It would be great if all podcasts came with a transcript, so I can quickly revisit the parts that interest me. Unfortunately, making transcripts to your podcasts can be quite expensive, which is why most authors don't do so or put them behind a paywall.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I tried to find my own solutions for this problem. With the spread of services like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Transcribe</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</a>, I figured this would not be difficult to make. I was not sure how much would it cost to use these services and how difficult it would be to use them, but I was willing to give it a try.</p>\n<p>After some googling, I found a solution already implemented that was almost what I was looking for: a series of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lambda</a> functions that would show a form to upload a podcast file to an S3 bucket and trigger a transcription job on Amazon Transcribe for the podcast file. When the transcription would be finished, another Lambda function would take the transcript and send it to me by email. And this solution was already implemented by Chris Kalafarski in his repo <a href=\"https://github.com/farski/serverless-transcribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">serverless-transcribe</a>. I want to thank Chris for taking the time to make this implementation and sharing it with everyone, it is very useful!❤️🙇‍♂️</p>\n<p>So I only had to deploy it in my AWS account using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SAM</a> CLI and in 5 minutes I was good to go. Even more, it would only cost me if I would use it, since the setup relies on Lambda functions and those generate costs only when you actually use them. Most of the costs would be for the actual transription service, Amazon Transcribe, that costs 0.0004 USD per second of transcribed audio (at the time of writing), which for a 45 minutes podcast would come up to 1.07 USD. Which is more than decent, since I don't listen so many podcasts every month and from the ones I listen, not so many are so dense that I feel the need of a transcript.</p>\n<p>There was something that I wanted to change though. I do most of my listening from my phone. It would be really great to be able to trigger the generation of a transcript from my phone. In its original shape, this solution requires me to upload the actual podcast file. Doing that from the phone is a bit cumbersome. It would be much better if I could put in the URL of the podcast, rather than having to upload a file. So I <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/serverless-transcribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forked Chris' repo</a> and modified his solution, by adding another Lambda function that receives the input from the form, downloads the media file from the URL provided in the form and uploads it to the S3 bucket. From then on, the flow stays the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/transcribe_form.png\" alt=\"The podcast upload form\"></p>\n<p>I also simplified the form a bit, since it didn't have to upload to the S3 bucket anymore and I added time intervals to each segment of speech in the transcript. The latter allows me to quickly relisten certain segments that are unclear and to know where exactly in the podcast to go to do that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/resulting_transcript.png\" alt=\"A sample of a transcript\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/serverless-transcribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This solution</a> helps me take better notes from podcasts and shorten the time I spend on building the monthly <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/reading-notes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reading Notes newsletter</a>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I learned quite a lot about developing serverless applications using AWS and SAM and while it was quite a steep learning for me, now I feel more confident in using Lambda functions in future projects.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>A book I've been reading lately revealed to me how tricky helping relationships can be, even though we put ourselves in such relationships several times every day and we don't even realise it. There are many things we do automatically successfully and we don't even think about it. Because we have been trained for many years by society and parents how to do it correctly according to the common rules. Helping others is no exception: we have been taught to help people around us that are in need and be receptive to others' pain and distress. All of this comes naturally to many of us. But that is not the case in all situations.</p>\n<p>One very interesting point that stuck with me after reading &quot;Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help&quot; by Edgar Schein is regarding the status imbalance that happens in a helping relationship, in the words of the author:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the beginning, every helping relationship is in a state of imbalance. The client is one down and therefore vulnerable; the helper is one up and therefore powerful. Much of what goes wrong in the helping process is failing to acknowledge this initial imbalance and deal with it. - Edgar Schein, &quot;Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this can apply to even the most common helping relationship, like helping someone and opening the door for them, I would like to focus on the relationship that happens between a consultant and his/her client. This is not something our automatic processes can handle, it requires conscious action from both parties. Which makes the imbalance mentioned above even more important to know of.</p>\n<p>First, as a consultant, it's important to identify who is your client. In the situation where a manager brings you to teach her team how to write code, who is your client: the manager or the team? Could both be your clients? How would the realisation that not all clients want your help influence your behavior? Could it be that the status imbalance is even more important to know of in this case, maybe even crucial?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the beginning of any helping situation the appropriate roles and the rules of equity are inherently ambiguous, which means that both the helper and the client have to develop an identity and choose a part to play. This ambiguity exists even when the formal roles seem clear—as when we visit a doctor or go to a computer consultant—because at the outset neither helper nor client know all the facts. This mutual ignorance is rarely acknowledged explicitly. - Edgar Schein, &quot;Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Truth is that in the beginning both helper and client don't really know how to develop the relationship. We start with the basics that society taught us: to shake hands and be respectful and formal. But other than that, anything could happen.</p>\n<p>One could ignore all of this and simply start giving advice and consult without knowing much about the client, maybe just some assumptions based on stereotyping and that could be very dangerous for the outcome. The author of the book suggests the helper takes an active role in sorting these out, the roles and the imbalance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To build a helping relationship that works therefore requires interventions on the part of the helper that build up the client’s status and elicit valid information. Starting out in the process consultant role is the most likely to facilitate status equilibration and to reveal the information necessary to decide on what kind of help is needed and how best to provide it. - Edgar Schein, &quot;Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So helpers need to find ways to level the imbalance from the start and the author suggests starting playing the process consultant role, which basically means to use different types of inquiry to find out more about the client's situation and build trust. Once more information is revealed and both helper and client have a better picture of the roles they should play, then the foundation of the helping relationship is set and the help can be given and received in a more effective way.</p>\n<p>While there are many more interesting points the author makes in the book, I don't want to make this post longer than it should be. What do you think? Did you experience any helping relationships that, in retrospect, failed because you were not aware of the dynamics between the helper and the client? Would you have done anything different?</p>\n",

Besides that, every highlighted resource is shareable through unique and private (or public) URLs, a pretty nice feature.</p>\n<p>And if you would like to build a digital <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&quot;commonplace book&quot;</a>, <a href=\"https://www.diigo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Diigo</a> has a feature called <a href=\"https://www.diigo.com/outliner/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outliner</a>. Those are some sort documents that you can create in your library and you can simply type formatted text or drag highlights from your library. So in the same way you would put index cards in a box, you can drag highlights into an outliner. You can open an outliner in parallel to a resource you're highlighting, just to make it simpler.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/Screenshot-2019-07-09-at-20.11.15.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the struggles I had in maintaining an analog commonplace book was to keep up with extracting highlights from books on index cards. It was very easy to fall behind and as the pile of read books was growing, the harder was to make time to extract highlights. With <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kindle</a> and Diigo, you don't have to do that: you can simply import highlights from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kindle</a> into Diigo and then drag them to the right outliner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remember_readwise\" tabindex=\"-1\">Remember Readwise?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#remember_readwise\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Remember Readwise?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Well, it got even better.

The Kindle app has support to create flashcards from highlights, but it is extremely basic and clunky. This is where <a href=\"http://readwise.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">readwise.io</a> comes in.</p>\n<p>Readwise will sync all your Kindle highlights regularly with its platform and gives you daily digests of highlights through email or (mobile) website, using some sort of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spaced repetition</a> algorithms.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/readwise1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can configure how often you should receive an email, if ever and if you want to use features like <a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/remember-more-of-what-you-read-with-readwise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Active Recall</a> where some words are hidden in the highlight to make you think about the context of the text and try to guess the missing words and this way improve retention.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/Screen-Shot-2019-03-04-at-20.53.03.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"nice_but_what_about_articles\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nice, but what about articles?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#nice_but_what_about_articles\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Nice, but what about articles?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It would be rather neat to be able to use Readwise on the articles you read also. Well, it turns out you can. If you use Pocket to save the articles you want to read, all you need to do is forward your articles to your Kindle, using a service like <a href=\"https://p2k.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pocket2Kindle</a>, highlight your articles on your Kindle device and then <a href=\"https://readwise.io/faq#from-what-sources-can-i-import-my-highlights-into-readwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">import the highlights from your Kindle device</a> directly into Readwise. This is a manual step that you would have to do every once in a while, but I think it is worth it, simply because you would have all highlights in one place.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, you can manually add highlights into Readwise or you can sync your Goodreads account with it and it will start showing popular highlights from the books you read in the past, but had no highlights for them in your Kindle account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/Screen-Shot-2019-03-04-at-20.52.46.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>What I like about this flow is that it requires very little effort and that I get to gather all the interesting pieces of information I stumble upon into one platform that is resurfacing them periodically. While it is a considerable improvement over not reviewing these highlights ever again, I feel there’s still something missing to make these stick and be internalised for long-term storage. I suspect it has something to do with the little amount of time and effort spent in learning them, which would be required to allow them to be integrated into our memory and make long-lasting connections to the existing bits of information in our brain.</p>\n",

I find this combo very useful for keeping myself on track with what I want to achieve and also be more present and balanced during the day.</p>\n<p>I started playing around with the idea of meditating several years ago when I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/006227726X/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan</a>, but it didn’t stick. I tried it several times again in the more recent years and I found it hard to practice every day.</p>\n<p>The reason for that was that I didn’t have a reliable trigger for the habit of meditation. The trick was to meditate first thing after waking up. I made sure I always had 10 minutes to do a short meditation before anything else. It’s been 120 days since and I haven’t missed a day.</p>\n<p>I soon started noticing some interesting effects.</p>\n<p>First of all, by meditating before I do anything else in a day, I set the stage for the day, before I get annoyed by the train delays or the broken coffee machine or whatever the day throws at me. By trying to focus on my breath for 10 minutes I manage to bring my mental state to the same levels every morning and get me ready for whatever comes. It also makes me feel good when I enforce my habit every day, my first task of the day is done. That’s how a productive day starts!</p>\n<p>But the morning meditation gives me another important ingredient for starting the day in a good way: thoughts. It is inevitable to not have all kind of thoughts going through my head while trying to follow my breath with my attention. Some days my mind is quieter, but in some days thoughts pass like cars in a busy intersection.</p>\n<p>I try to acknowledge everything that goes through my head and remember the ones reoccurring the most while I gently resume following my breathing. During the meditation practice many worries or negative thoughts would pop up sometimes. By acknowledging them and setting them aside their effect is already diminished, but I don’t just completely forget them yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"journaling\" tabindex=\"-1\">Journaling</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#journaling\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Journaling”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>A complementary practice to meditation is journaling. I found it very hard to spend more than 30 mins a day for writing in a journal, so I tried to contain it to that time. I started from the <a href=\"https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 minute journal format</a>, but I adjusted it a bit. Here’s what I do:</p>\n<h3 id=\"morning\" tabindex=\"-1\">Morning</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#morning\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Morning”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/Screenshot-2018-11-04-at-19.16.03.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Soon after my meditation, I fill-in the sections above.</p>\n<blockquote>Reflect on your present blessings, on which every man has many, not\n<p>on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.</p>\n<p>— Charles Dickens</blockquote></p>\n<p>I start with expressing my gratitude for specific things in my life that I am grateful for. You might feel that there isn’t much to be grateful for, but if you look closer, you’ll soon realise that there is a gazillion of things to be grateful for. There are several <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/sheldon-SustainPositiveEmotion.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies</a> saying that expressing your gratitude more often will <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/6Emmons-BlessingsBurdens.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">improve</a> your general state of well-being.</p>\n<p>Next, I write my purpose, or what I want to achieve in my life on a long term. It shouldn’t be anything advanced and for me I write pretty much the same thing every day. This is an important thing to figure out and many people struggle to answer to this question. Maybe for starters your purpose should be to find your purpose. Writing your purpose at this point is important for the next section.</p>\n<p>Considering your purpose and whatever you know it’s coming today, what do you want to achieve today? I list here briefly what individual things are important to achieve or start during this day. This is not a to-do list necessarily, it is more of an exercise of acknowledging your priorities and writing them down.</p>\n<p>Finally, before starting my actual day, I end the morning journaling with a few statements related to how I feel, how I think the day will be going and acknowledge some of the thoughts that came up during meditation, this time by writing them shortly. I also remind myself of what behaviors I am prone to do and should avoid and whatever else is relevant for that day. This section is less specific for a reason and its meant to acknowledge whatever I think is lurking around my mind and to state explicitly whatever didn’t fit in the other sections, but it is important to bring to light before I get going.</p>\n<h3 id=\"evening\" tabindex=\"-1\">Evening</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#evening\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Evening”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/Screenshot-2018-11-04-at-19.17.30.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I wrap it up with putting down some thoughts about how did the day go, with more focus on what went well, rather than on didn’t go so well. Finally, I write a few lines about what I could’ve done better through the day.</p>\n<p>I find both meditation and journaling very good practices to increase self-awareness and to bring out into the open worries or negative thoughts that usually lurk in the back of your mind and affect you during the day without you realizing the cause. I want to be at my best every day, so I can better help, listen or interact with others.</p>\n",

These are not part of the main idea of the book, but I found them as powerful as they are simple.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gravity_problems\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gravity problems</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#gravity_problems\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Gravity problems”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/JhncGNdBoyeKk/source.gif\" alt=\"via GIPHY\"></p>\n<p>A gravity problem is a problem that is not actionable. If you see gravity as a problem and you decide to fight it, to “solve” it, you will realise sooner or later that it is unsolvable and you would be far off better with accepting it as a reality and find ways to work around it.</p>\n<p>That means that instead of cursing into your breath and wasting energy complaining about it when you cannot just fly to work, you accept it and take the bus and get on with your life. Sure this is a rather juvenile and obvious example, but there are many people in companies getting stuck fighting gravity problems without realising. They get more frustrated and frustrated, until they quit their company and move on to another, where they soon end up more or less in the same fight. I’m not trying to suggest that people quit jobs only because of misperceived gravity problems, but I tend to believe they are more common than we would like to admit it.</p>\n<p>What I am suggesting, in the end, is to be conscious about the problems you try to tackle or get frustrated by. Are they actionable? Can you do something about them? If not, try to accept them as they are, as part of the reality and free up energy to invest in things you can influence.</p>\n<p>The authors of the book include in the gravity problems category also large scale issues that could be actionable, but require enormous amount of effort to be invested and there’s a good chance you would not be able to see any effects (except your despair) in a short amount of time. Like equal pay for genders or eradicating slavery. Now if everyone would’ve accepted these issues and moved on in the past, then we wouldn’t have been where we are now. That’s not what the authors suggest. Instead, they are simply advising to be conscious about the challenges you are undertaking and be honest with yourself about your expectations to progress, if you decide to attack such a problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor_problems\" tabindex=\"-1\">Anchor problems</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#anchor_problems\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Anchor problems”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3rjZId225LNpgoLr1R/source.gif\" alt=\"via GIPHY\"></p>\n<p>With anchor problems, although they are actionable, we are anchored to a specific solution and we are stuck trying to pursue just that one, even though there are other solutions which could give similar results. When we perceive a certain solution as the only way to get out of a problem and that solution is difficult to accomplish, we become stuck.</p>\n<p>When this happens, the first step is to be aware of it. Second step is to try to pivot, find alternative ways to solve our problem and let go of the unachievable way out. It’s very simple to dream of this shiny happy way of solving a problem, but it may be just an excuse to not really tackle it. Many times there are multiple ways to get us to our target and many times they are just one pivot away.</p>\n<p>So next time we are stuck with a problem, we should ask: is this a gravity problem I keep hitting? Is the problem actionable? Or, am I anchored on a specific solution? Can I attack this from a different angle?</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Every year, I manage to read one or two books that get my mind going and give me ideas that I could either apply right away or that set me on a larger path of discovery. One or two out of tens, or to be more specific, last year, out of thirty. I started to look into ways I could organise notes and ideas that I find in books in a better way. When I read about the <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commonplace</a> <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book</a> method on Ryan Holiday’s <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog</a>, I was a bit reluctant, but I liked the idea of taking notes by hand. It feels more real and I have the impression that my comprehension is better this way. From a great book, it is not unusual to gather about 30 notes. Well, this year so far I managed to gather 113 notes from only 3 books. Feels already like it’s gonna be a good year for reading. Let me tell you a bit about these books.</p>\n<h2 id=\"talk_like_ted_by_carmine_gallo\" tabindex=\"-1\">Talk like TED by Carmine Gallo</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#talk_like_ted_by_carmine_gallo\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Talk like TED by Carmine Gallo”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/2018/04/talkliketed.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of my ambitions this year is to give a talk at a conference about the <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/2017/05/22/teams-are-made-of-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">things</a> I’m <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/2017/05/07/agile-is-also-about-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">passionate</a> <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/the-vision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about</a> and try out and share ideas with the public. So when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anachiritescu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ana </a>recommended me this book, it came at the right time.</p>\n<p>The book can be cheesy at times, but I think has some really good tips and advice for creating and giving a great presentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sparkline\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sparkline</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#sparkline\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Sparkline”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One of the very interesting ideas is the one of [Nancy Duarte’s Sparkline]((<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/15737166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://vimeo.com/15737166</a>). She did research on many impactful and motivational presentations and found a pattern. They all have a specific shape:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ideate-140312150726-phpapp01/95/ideate-create-and-develop-worldchanging-ideas-39-638.jpg?cb=1395743550\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All these successful presentations are a sequence of back and forth, between what is (without your idea) and what could be (with your idea). This gap creates some sort of tension that drives your audience towards your call to action in the end and what they could achieve if they incorporated your idea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule_of_three_message_maps_and_18_mins\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rule of three, message maps and 18 mins</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#rule_of_three_message_maps_and_18_mins\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Rule of three, message maps and 18 mins”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>When it comes to how ideas should be in a presentation, Carmine Gallo talks about the <code>Rule of Three</code>, which ‘simply means that people can remember three pieces of information really well; add more items and retention falls off considerably’. So if you want your audience to remember most of your ideas, then limit the content.</p>\n<p>Bring these ideas in a <code>message map</code>, which ‘can help you pitch anything in as little as 15 seconds or to shape the framework for a longer 18-minute presentation.’</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2018/04/message_map.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Noticed the 18 minute mention in the last quote? Well, there is a <a href=\"https://www.labnol.org/tech/ted-talk-18-minutes/12755/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reason</a> for all TED talks to last 18 minutes. A short presentation keeps people engaged and it can easier go viral, because more people can find time to watch it between their daily activities. Also, go much over 18 minutes, and you risk loosing your audience in listening exhaustion or attention fatigue. So keep it short and sweet. 🙂</p>\n<h3 id=\"pump_up_your_presentation’s_pathos\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pump up your presentation’s pathos</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#pump_up_your_presentation’s_pathos\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Pump up your presentation’s pathos”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>If you’re looking to persuade the audience to invest in your idea (either money, time or attention) then you should have a good balance of ethos (credibility), logos (logic, data and statistic) and pathos (emotions) according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aristotle</a>. But great presentations seem to have a bit more pathos than the other components. Stories that come from personal experiences or stories ‘about other people who have learned a lesson the audience can relate to’. These bring the ideas closer to the audience and make the presentation more persuasive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_solutions_focus_by_paul_z_jackson_and_mark_mckergow\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Solutions Focus, by Paul Z.

Jackson and Mark McKergow”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/2018/04/TheSolutionsFocus.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I have always been preoccupied by the idea of coaching myself or others, but since I started to be a team manager, I felt I needed to invest more time into learning about this topic. Late last year I found out about this book and the idea of solutions focused coaching from <a href=\"https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/my-organisational-psychotherapy-toolkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bob Marshall’s post</a> and thought to give it a try.</p>\n<p>I have since used it in retrospectives for teams and I started doing coaching sessions with the members of my team, based on the format described in the book. It is great to see the retro outcomes and the energy brought by this approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focus_on_solutions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Focus on solutions</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#focus_on_solutions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Focus on solutions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>Change is happening all the time: our job is to identify and amplify useful change.</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>It means being absolutely clear about what you want, discovering what is already working well, then encouraging the processes that strengthen these positive forces.</blockquote>\n<p>As it turns out, focusing on the problem <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK68124/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rarely helps</a> , although that is the most predominant approach when trying to solve a problem. We go deeper and deeper in trying to understand what goes wrong. While it is useful to get a general understanding of the problem and its cause, investing a lot of energy and time into that could also make us overlook what does go right and chase our tail in circles around the problem.</p>\n<p>So focus on what works instead and make sure to do more of that. As follows, there’s a simplified version of the framework described in the book.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the_idea_of_a_future_perfect\" tabindex=\"-1\">The idea of a future perfect</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_idea_of_a_future_perfect\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The idea of a future perfect”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><blockquote>Suppose that tonight you go to bed - and go to sleep as usual - and during the night a miracle happens - and the problem vanishes - and the issues that concern you are resolved - but you’re asleep, so you don’t know that the miracle has happened - so when you wake up tomorrow what will be the first things that will tell you that the miracle has happened? How will you know that the transformation has occurred?</blockquote>\n<p>Start with imagining the ideal, the future perfect, but not in any way. The context is set as a miracle so you don’t spend time thinking on how to achieve the future perfect. Or you don’t limit yourself on what you think you <em>can</em> achieve. Just imagine the perfect situation without restrictions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scale_counters_and_small_actions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scale, counters and small actions</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#scale_counters_and_small_actions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Scale, counters and small actions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Next step is to scale the current state, from 0 (worst) to 10 (future perfect). I think this is more of a trick exercise. Because most people will position themselves somewhere in the middle. Which is exactly what I think it is expected. That implies that you are doing certain things in the right direction, but you still have work to do. This leaves space for learning and also for improvement.</p>\n<p>After scaling, search for the counters. What are you doing right that made you position yourself above 0? I suspect this step was thought to prepare the context for the next one, small steps. Because you want to search and acknowledge the things you are doing in the right direction now and then amplify them. This prepares the ground for the next stage, which is to think of what small actions you can take to get you to the next level. Maybe these actions can be based on what works already or can be completely new. You have the option, the goal is to get you one step further.</p>\n<p>What I like mostly about this framework of looking at problems is its simplicity and its focus on what is desired and what it already works. There are several principles and situations described in the book which I recommend you to read, but this is what stuck with me after reading the book. It’s a book I will keep close while I try the method in different situations and experiment with it in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_fifth_discipline_by_peter_m_senge\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifth Discipline by Peter M. Senge</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_fifth_discipline_by_peter_m_senge\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The Fifth Discipline by Peter M. Senge”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"/img/2018/04/TheFifthDiscipline.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This book is a true gem and it gave me so many inspiring thoughts. It also re-sparked my interest towards systems thinking, this black magic of making sense of complexity through reinforcing and balancing loops and delays. The rest of this post is mostly a list of quotes. I feel like I need to go over it several times before I can internalise its content and present it in my own way.</p>\n<blockquote>At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind - from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something “out there” to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience.</blockquote>\n<p>A learning organization needs to master five disciplines…</p>\n<blockquote>Building _shared vision_ fosters a commitment to the long term. _Mental models_ focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings in our present ways of seeing the world. _Team learning_ develops the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond the individual perspectives. And _personal mastery_ fosters the personal motivation to continually learn how our actions affect the world. Lastly, _systems thinking_ makes understandable the subtlest aspect of the learning organization - the new way individuals perceive themselves and the world.</blockquote>\n<p>Out of which, systems thinking is the one bringing all the others together, making each individual understand how everything is interconnected and how the structures put in place affect their work.</p>\n<blockquote>When placed in the same system, people, however different, tend to produce similar results.</blockquote>\n<p>On personal mastery…</p>\n<blockquote>People with a high level of personal master live in a continual learning mode. They never “arrive”. Sometimes language, such as the term “personal master”, creates a misleading sense of definiteness, of black and white. But personal master is not something you possess. It is a process. It is a lifelong discipline. People with a high level of personal mastery are acutely aware of their ignorance, their incompetence, their growth areas. And they are deeply self-confident. Paradoxical? Only for those who do not see that “the journey is the reward.”</blockquote>\n<p>Detail complexity vs dynamic complexity</p>\n<blockquote>Sophisticated tools of forecasting and business analysis, as well as elegant strategic plans, usually fail to produce dramatic breakthroughs in managing a business. They are all designed to handle the sort of complexity in which there are many variables: detail complexity. […] The second type is dynamic complexity, situations where cause and effect are subtle, and where the effects over time of interventions are not obvious.</blockquote>\n<p>Being aware of the inner workings of the system we are part of increases our empathy towards the other members.</p>\n<blockquote>We are used to thinking of compassion as an emotional state, based on our concern for one another. But it is also grounded in a level of awareness. In my experience, as people see more of the systems within which they operate, and as they understand more clearly the pressures influencing one another, they naturally develop more compassion and empathy.</blockquote>\n<p>Excellent metaphor for creative tension:</p>\n<blockquote>Imagine a rubber band, stretched between your vision and current reality. When stretched, the rubber band creates tension, representing the tension between vision and current reality. What does tension seek? Resolution or release. There are only two possible ways for tension to resolve itself: pull reality toward the vision or pull the vision toward reality. Which occurs will depend on whether we hold steady to the vision.</blockquote>\n<p>Powerlessness and unworthiness:</p>\n<blockquote>Most of us hold one of two contradictory beliefs that limit our ability to create what we really want. The more common is belief in our powerlessness - our inability to bring into being all the things we really care about. The other belief centre on unworthiness - that we do not deserve to have what we truly desire.</blockquote>\n<p>Mental models can hold us back:</p>\n<blockquote>New insights fail to get put into practice because they conflict with deeply held internal images of how the world works, images that limit us to familiar ways of thinking and acting.</blockquote>\n<p>About managers and problems:</p>\n<blockquote>Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. I call such situations messes. Managers do not solve problems, they manage messes.</blockquote>\n<p>Dimensions of team learning in an organization:</p>\n<blockquote>Within organizations, team learning has three critical dimensions. First, there is the need to think insightfully about complex issues. Second, there is the need for innovative, coordinated action. Third, there is the role of team members on other teams. For example, most of the actions of senior teams are actually carried out through other teams.</blockquote>\n<p>About vision and empowerment:</p>\n<blockquote>There is commonality of purpose, a shared vision, and understanding of how to complement one another’s efforts. Individuals do not sacrifice their personal interests to the larger team vision; rather, the shared vision becomes an extension of their personal visions. In fact, alignment is the necessary condition before empowering the individual will empower the whole team. Empowering the individual where there is a relatively low level of alignment worsens the chaos and makes managing the team even more difficult.</blockquote>\n<p>And there would be more, many, many more. Hoping that I opened your appetite to read these great books, I encourage you to read them and make your own opinion about them.</p>\n",

I wish more governments will follow suit and implement similar ways of allowing the people who they represent to contribute on running their country, region or city.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8379-1024x822.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8374-1024x601.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>Collaboration starts with the goal, a meeting starts with the time</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8373-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>Games are the ideal collaboration tool</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8372-1024x581.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8371-1024x617.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>Lundy’s law: given enough time, any developer will find a reason for a total rewrite</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8370-1024x305.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8369-1024x659.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8368-1024x389.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8367-1024x687.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8366-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8365-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8361-1024x629.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8381-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"case_study_you_can_do_better_than_the_spotify_model_by_joakim_sundén_joakimsunden\" tabindex=\"-1\">Case Study: <em>You can do better than the Spotify Model</em> by Joakim Sundén (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/joakimsunden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JoakimSunden</a>)</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#case_study_you_can_do_better_than_the_spotify_model_by_joakim_sundén_joakimsunden\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Case Study: You can do better than the Spotify Model by Joakim Sundén (@JoakimSunden)”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I am convinced Joakim’s talk shattered a lot of people’s dreams, dreams of an ideal Spotify model of success, that can be easily copied and implemented in tech companies to make them successful.

I found this to be an interesting technique to determine root causes to different problems you have in an organisation. It needs some practice, as it gets pretty easy to get confused with which effects are intermediate or UDEs. But once mastered, I can imagine it is a very useful tool to understand problems or situations you encounter, which don’t have an obvious solution and can be more difficult to crack.</p>\n<p>Bellow are the notes I made and some of my photos.

In the second round, one of us would make everything in his/her power not to listen to the other. Some even left the room or were speaking with other attendants. <strong>How did that affect the others who were trying to communicate with the ones avoiding communication?</strong></p>\n<p>Following up, we gathered the most common topics that came up during retros in our own companies. Per each table, we picked one of the most common topic in the group and tried to brainstorm and come up with solutions to it. Anything that came into our mind, we would just put it on the wall. Next, we rotated tables, so each group would be facing another group’s post-its. It was time to try to group, remove, combine, add or modify the post-its done by the owners of the post-its.

There are many factors that contribute to this situation and at the same time, it is pretty difficult to notice and prevent, especially in a culture of continuous exponential growth and “always busyness”. There is not much awareness about the signs or causes of the burnouts, which is why I decided to join John’s presentation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/2017/10/IMG_8160-1024x556.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>What is burnout?</p>\n<blockquote>“A psychological syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishment… as emotional resources are depleted workers feel they are no longer able to give themselves at psychological level” - Christina Maslach\n<p>“Burnout really is a response to stress.

      "content_html": "<p>The main duty of a developer is to build and improve features of a service or a product, either through big-bang releases or through continuous delivery. The second most time consuming activity (besides meetings, of course) in the life of a developer is fixing bugs and eliminating tech debt.</p>\n<p>Bugs and tech debt have the nasty habit of generating urgent issues that prevent a service to function properly. When these happen, developers need to take immediate actions to bring back the service in a state of normality, as much as possible, as fast as possible. We like to call this firefighting.</p>\n<p>Like putting out a fire, we need to bring the service in a state that at least is stable, followed by an investigation into what triggered the “fire” and eventually do fixes and manual data corrections.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the amount of firefighting a development team does is very small. It is in everyone’s interest to have a smooth-running service. The way you handle a “fire” towards <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/2017/08/06/software-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your users</a> can also be very important.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why_do_fires_happen\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why do fires happen?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#why_do_fires_happen\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Why do fires happen?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Surely nobody wants them. They bring stressful moments to developers and product managers, not to mention the whole company can suffer substantial image damage and lose customers.</p>\n<p>Fires happen because of two main reasons, which many times go together:</p>\n<pre><code>  * cutting corners to release faster\n  * inappropriate QA processes\n</code></pre>\n<p>I still get chills down my spine when I remember a call I had with our system administrator at a previous workplace who was counting down the disk space available on the database machine of a service we were building.

It’s inevitable to accumulate some technical or functional debt here and there, otherwise you would always be late to the party. Someone would’ve already done it by then. Also, if you wait to implement everything perfect before releasing it, you will fail to get precious feedback from your users.</p>\n<p>No, you’ll have to cut down on the scope of the release sometimes and sometimes you’ll have to accumulate some technical debt. But when you do so, you should already have a plan to eliminate it very soon. And you should definitely not skip implementing features that help you inspect and debug your service while running. Not to mention tests.</p>\n<p>I would be more relaxed when cutting some corners here and there, if I trust my test pipelines and I know I got many of the corner cases covered. Because those are usually the ones that will haunt you in production, causing hours or days of misfortune.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so_in_conclusion…\" tabindex=\"-1\">So, in conclusion…</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so_in_conclusion…\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “So, in conclusion…”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Software fires happen to the best of us, it all depends on how ready you are to handle them.</p>\n<p>It’s inevitable to accumulate functional and technical debt, but do not ship software without logging or tests, that’s just insane.</p>\n<p>Debt is a luxury that only the ones who have good testing pipelines and development practices can afford.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>As a developer, my first impulse when the service I’m developing is malfunctioning is to jump right on it and try to fix it. But while I do that, I can’t help thinking about who is affected by it and how bad and if they will notice it. Then there’s the first five to ten minutes of the investigation, when I realise how far I am from finding a solution, yet, I keep thinking “Almost there, almost there!”. Five minutes become twenty and twenty become an hour. In the meantime, users start reaching out, asking what’s going on.</p>\n<p>That moment right there has a very sour taste. You don’t have a solution and you didn’t notify your users about the issue. You feel the pressure and you start thinking on how to recover your face towards the user.</p>\n<p>You could go all out and ignore the users calling until you fix the problem. Show up after that with an apology washed in the good news of saving the day. Eventually.</p>\n<p>But you lost their confidence and trust.

They become irritated when they have to come and ask you every hour what’s the status. I’m pretty sure they don’t enjoy it.

When they pay for an app or service, they trust that its creators will have their back and fix it fast with minimum of fuss if something happens. The interesting part is that even if there is a more serious issue with the service, there is a way to not damage that trust much. And that is by letting your users know as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>This way, they know you are on top of it and you are making everything possible to fix it. Plus, you get to focus on fixing the issue, rather than dealing with angry users on the side.</p>\n",

The team has a simple process in place based on context and taking in consideration the individual differences.

What does it mean that this team that provides a service, or builds a product or works on a project, what does it mean that it is made of people? And to the extent of that, what does it mean that the users or the stakeholders are also people?</p>\n<p>Any person has ambitions and needs. Some of them are quite basic like eating and being loved or being part of a group and some are a bit more abstract, like feeling respected or accomplished. We spend all our life chasing one or the other. And unless you are a Buddhist monk in one of the most deserted corners of the world, being self-sufficient, then you will need other people to fulfil your ambition.</p>\n<p>So your users (internal or external) are people like you, with ambitions and needs, who expect great service and are busy chasing their own path in life. With this in mind, let’s focus a bit more on the team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what_does_this_mean_for_the_team\" tabindex=\"-1\">What does this mean for the team?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what_does_this_mean_for_the_team\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “What does this mean for the team?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I assume that the people you have in your team are there by choice and they made this choice because it somehow contributes to their ambitions.

So make sure the members of the team feel comfortable with each other. Run all kind of exercises like <a href=\"https://alexchiri.com/2016/08/28/my-personal-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal maps</a>, go out for beers, team building, whatever it takes to break the ice. Team members don’t have to be best buddies, but they should be comfortable enough with each other in order to collaborate effectively for a big chunk of the time they are awake every day. The next step is to trust each other. This is not about being open about the most personal things. It’s about being comfortable and have enough trust in your co-workers so you can feel safe to make mistakes and be wrong about some things.</p>\n<p>Be aware of the <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/63/6/384/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four stages of forming a team</a>, the team will reach the level of high performance much faster if you consciously address issues typical for any of the stages.</p>\n<p>Identifying personality types in the team could be an interesting idea to explore. There are <a href=\"https://businesschemistry.deloitte.com/Login/Index?ReturnUrl=%2f#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many</a> tests and guidelines out there. As long as you take them with a pinch of salt and stay away of labelling everyone with their dominant traits. The biggest outcome of knowing this is to be aware that there might be certain tendencies in the team towards different behaviours or that members of the team tend to be more open towards certain behaviours.</p>\n<p><em>A team of people needs a an environment where they can feel safe to fail and admit when they’re wrong.

A person with a fresh perspective is joining the team. Take this opportunity to rethink the way you do things. Don’t see it as a threat, but encourage the new person to challenge everything, but maybe in a controlled way.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have a simple but somewhat structured way to bring the new member up-to-speed with the team’s knowledge. Personally, I love <a href=\"https://blog.crisp.se/2017/03/15/jangrape/how-to-onboard-a-new-team-member-faster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the idea</a> of having a set of topics the team masters written on cards. Whenever a new person joins, he/she receives a copy and he/she is responsible for learning about those from the other team colleagues.

Or maybe that’s just my impression. There are <a href=\"https://www.google.se/search?q=mindfulness+training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many trainings and meditation</a> experts out there, luring you to the places of clarity and tranquility, ability of getting over stressful and painful experiences in an easier way and experiencing life in a richer way.</p>\n<p>I don’t know from a personal experience this to be a truthful promise, but that doesn’t mean it is not true. I sure want it to be so. In a world where stress (psychological) is causing serious damage to our health (physical), you hope there is a way to cope with stress in a maintainable way.</p>\n<p>Young’s book is not what would necessarily qualify as an easy read. But then again, the subject at hand, enlightenment, is not the most easy to define concept. I enjoyed the different parallels between different traditions of Buddhism and the clarification on some of the terms. I find that I know much more about the different facets of mindfulness and I understand better what enlightenment is.</p>\n<p>But then again, there are some things that left me with a weird taste. While it would be very easy to categorise them like nonsense, I suspect that it’s a matter of experience. There are many things I didn’t experience and maybe never will. Hearing someone talking about some of these, might sound a bit like fantasy, especially when it comes to less common experiences.</p>\n<p>I prefer to keep an open mind and keep on reading, learning and practicing meditation. This is definitely a book that requires several reads, you will probably resonate differently to this book based on how far you are in your mindfulness training.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes_&amp;_highlights\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notes &amp; Highlights</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#notes_&amp;_highlights\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Notes &amp; Highlights”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>A central notion of Buddhism is that there’s not a thing inside us called a self. One way to express that is to say that we are a colony of sub-personalities and each of those sub-personalities is in fact not a noun but a verb—a doing.</p>\n<p>Defining enlightenment is notoriously tricky. Almost anything you say about it, no matter how true, may also be misleading. Having said that, here’s a place to start: you can think of enlightenment as a kind of permanent shift in perspective that comes about through direct realization that there is no thing called “self” inside you. This is a very rough and ready definition. We might call it the “executive summary.” Notice that I’m not saying that there is no self, but rather no thing called a self. Of course, there is certainly an activity inside you called personality, an activity of the self.</p>\n<p>Meditation changes your relationship to sensory experience, including your thoughts and body sensations. It allows you to experience thoughts and body sensations in a clear and unblocked way. When the sensory experience of the mind-body becomes sufficiently clear and uninhibited, it ceases to be a rigid thing that imprisons your identity. The sensory self becomes a comfortable home, not a jail cell. That’s why enlightenment is sometimes referred to as liberation. You realize that the thingness of self is an artifact caused by habitual nebulosity and viscosity around your mind-body experience.</p>\n<p>Equanimity is the ability to allow sensory experience to well up without suppression and to pass away without identifying with it.</p>\n<p>The first is to experience some degree of samadhi during formal sitting. The next is to experience it during simple tasks like cleaning, then to maintain it during more complex tasks like cooking meals, serving guests at the temple, and so forth. The next level of challenge would be to stay in samadhi during small talk. The ultimate challenge would be to stay in samadhi while having important, emotionally charged, social interactions with others.</p>\n<p>I like to describe mindfulness as a threefold attentional skill set: concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity working together.</p>\n<p>You can practice meditation while talking to someone. In fact, you could do that in a number of different ways. You can do that by intently focusing on the sights and sounds of that person—so intently focusing on those sights and sounds that you enter into what Martin Buber calls an “I-Thou” relationship with them. I call that approach Focus Out.</p>\n<p>Another way would be to monitor, in a state of high concentration, your mental and emotional reactions to that person. I call that approach Focus In. Yet another way to meditate while talking to a person would be to intentionally create lovingkindness emotion in your body and then taste an expansive flavor of concentration by spreading that pleasant body sensation out into the room, enveloping your interlocutor with love. I call that approach Nurture Positivity.</p>\n<p>With the combination of formal practice in stillness, formal practice in motion, and informal practice in daily life, your meditative skills grow in two dimensions. On one hand, deeper and deeper meditative states become available. On the other, you are able to maintain those states throughout more and more complex activities of life.</p>\n<p>There are actually four subskills to concentration: learning how to restrict attention to small sensory events, learning how to evenly cover large sensory events, learning how to sustain concentration on one thing for an extended period of time, and learning how to taste a momentary state of concentration with whatever randomly calls your attention.</p>\n<p>In the early twentieth century, the Burmese master Mahasi Sayadaw realized that momentary concentration (khanikasamadhi) on whatever spontaneously comes or calls could be as powerful as sustained concentration on one thing. This insight allowed him to develop a distinctive way to do mindfulness practice. At the time, this method was referred to as “the Burmese method of satipatthana,” but nowadays, it is simply called “noting.” Noting is currently perhaps the most popular approach to mindfulness both in the East and the West. But when Mahasi first started teaching it, it generated considerable controversy. Some masters from Thailand and Sri Lanka claimed that “noting whatever arises” is indistinguishable from a scattered, wandering state of mind. Mahasi pointed out (and quite correctly in my opinion) that momentary concentration is key. To “note” an experience entails more than just labeling it. Whether you use labels or not, to note a sensory event implies that you attempt to tangibly taste a momentary state of high focus upon that sensory event. This skill is especially useful for staying deep during complex daily activities.</p>\n<p>Meditation is something that a person does for themselves, but it’s also something a person does to make the world a better place and to be of service to others.</p>\n<p>The ultimate personal goal of meditation is to achieve happiness independent of conditions.</p>\n<p>Happiness independent of conditions occurs whenever we have a complete sensory experience. To have a complete experience means to experience something in a state of extraordinary concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity.</p>\n<p>Any ordinary sensory event, when experienced completely, becomes extraordinary and paradoxical: its richness is maximal but its somethingness is minimal. A complete experience of pleasure delivers pure satisfaction but has little substance. A complete experience of pain is deeply poignant but not problematic. A complete experience of desire is desireless. A complete experience of mental confusion nurtures intuitive wisdom. A complete experience of self convinces you there never was a self.</p>\n<p>Meditation is partially something you do to help yourself at many levels, including the ultimate level, which is to transcend your self. People usually identify with their thoughts and feelings, their minds and their bodies. The thinking mind and the feeling body thus become a prison within which most people spend their lives. Meditation makes it possible to transcend that limited identity, so that the mind and body become a home that you can go in and out of, rather than a prison that you are stuck in. And how do you free your mind-body? By having a complete experience of your mind-body! This is one possible way of viewing the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>Most people don’t maintain a continuous mindful relationship with their subjective thoughts and feelings, so most people do not have the ability to experience anger, fear, sadness, shame, and confusion without suffering. When an objective problem presents itself, it produces uncomfortable subjective mental and emotional states, and you suffer. A salient feature of suffering is that it distorts behavior.</p>\n<p>Meditation allows us to experience pain without suffering and pleasure without neediness. The difference between pain and suffering may seem subtle, but it is highly significant.</p>\n<p>When physical or emotional pain is experienced in a state of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, it still hurts but in a way that bothers you less. You actually feel it more deeply. It’s more poignant but, at the same time, less problematic. More poignant means it motivates and directs action. Less problematic means it stops driving and distorting actions.</p>\n<p>When we are involved in the path of love and service, we need self-care, a resource to avoid what I call the “three outs”: Burn-Out, when we lose energy and motivation to help; Bum-Out, when we suffer deeply when our efforts to help don’t work; and Freak-Out, when we respond in a distorted, perhaps even abusive way.</p>\n<p>The monastic system of Europe was founded by Saint Benedict. According to the Benedictine tradition, the main reason for entering the monastery is to attain a habitually concentrated state (recollectio) and to use that to radically transform one’s self (conversio). A monastery is like a giant feedback mechanism where a person’s life is simplified, and there is nothing to do but concentration-building activities like simple physical labor, chanting, prayer, and so on. Before the Counter-Reformation (in the sixteenth century), obtaining the prayer of quiet was deemed central to European Christian life. It’s still central in the Eastern Orthodox form of Christianity.</p>\n<p>First came the philosophy of oneness exemplified in the teachings of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. In this system, the mystical “one” was called the Tao. We achieve the Tao through surrendering to the fundamental forces of the universe, expansion (yang) and contraction (yin). Later masters developed an elaborate technology of physical exercises involving three steps to facilitate this process. First essence (jing) is transmuted into energy (qi). Then energy is transmuted into spirit (shen).</p>\n<p>Although the words sound quite different, the Taoist experience of qi and shen is related to the Buddhist experience of anicca (impermanence). Qi and shen represent two stages in the process of contacting the impermanent nature of a given sensory event. After you have held a single sensory quality in a concentrated state long enough (essence, jing), you start to notice subtle waves and vibrations in that event. Those waves and vibrations are qi. At a deeper level, that sensory event polarizes into pure yang and pure yin. Pure yang is a kind of efflux—space effortlessly spreading out. Pure yin is a kind of reflux—space effortlessly pulling in. Space itself is simultaneously expanding and contracting. That’s shen. This roughly parallels something that happens in the material world: a frozen substance may melt into liquid (jing), then vaporizes into gas (qi), and finally polarizes into a plasma (shen).</p>\n<p>According to the Raja yoga system, the first step in the concentration continuum is dharana, which literally means “holding.” In dharana, you take some object and attempt to concentrate your awareness on it. The object of focus could be anything: the breath, a sound, a visualization, a flower, a person. When your attention wanders, which inevitably it will, you gently bring it back to the object. When it wanders again, you gently bring it back again, over and over. This act of bringing the attention back each time it wanders is called dharana. We are making an effort to hold on to the focus object.</p>\n<p>The second step in Raja yoga’s concentration continuum is called dhyana. This word could cause some confusion, because the term is used in Buddhism in a similar but not identical way. Within the context of Raja yoga, dhyana is what comes after we have paid our dues, so to speak. We’ve brought our attention back over and over again to our object of focus, and finally, the attention doesn’t wander, but stays put, gently resting on that object.</p>\n<p>The third and final step in Raja yoga’s concentration continuum is samadhi, which refers to unitive experience. Again, there is a possible confusion in terminology here, because in Buddhism samadhi often refers to any level of concentration, from the lightest to the deepest. In the state of samadhi as understood in Raja yoga, we not only have unbroken concentration, but we actually become the thing we are concentrating on. This is what is meant by the often-heard phrase “to become one with something.”</p>\n<p>That’s the growth of concentration as described in the Yoga Sutras. We progress from simple focus exercises (dharana), to states of continuous concentration (dhyana), and finally to oneness with the unborn Source (nirbija, or seedless, samadhi). If you can consciously taste moments of seedless samadhi in daily life, we’ll say you attained the initial stage of enlightenment.</p>\n<p>While concentrating and calming down is certainly a part of meditation, it is only half of the story. The other half of the process is clarifying, that is, observing, analyzing, and deconstructing sensory experience. Clarifying leads to insight. This clarifying aspect of meditation is known technically as vipassana. One way to think about meditation is as a dialectical interplay between a calming-concentrating aspect (samatha) and a clarifying-dissecting aspect (vipassana). For simplicity, I’ll just call these two sides of meditation the calming part and the clarifying part.</p>\n<p><em>There are subtle, fleeting, restful experiences available to anyone during the day: physical relaxation, an absence of body emotion, a brief pause in mental talk, and the darkness/brightness behind your closed eyes. These are visual, auditory, and somatic restful states that are available once you know what to look for. Most people aren’t even aware that these states are happening. But if you use them as an object of concentration, then the small pleasure they produce becomes more pronounced, more pleasant. When you then concentrate even more, they become more pronounced, creating a feedback cycle. Through concentration, you magnify those tiny, subtle, pleasant experiences into something that is hugely enjoyable and available to you any time you want. It’s not exactly getting something from nothing, but it’s getting quite a lot from a very little. I call this approach Focus on Rest. You let your attention move between visual rest (darkness/brightness behind your closed eyes or defocused external gaze), auditory rest (mental quiet or physical silence), and somatic rest (physical relaxation and emotional tranquility).</em></p>\n<p>The Buddha was not some sort of god or myth. He was an actual, historical person named Siddhartha Gautama. He was a prince, the son of the king of the Shakya nation, which was located in modern-day Nepal.</p>\n<p>Siddhartha Gautama was born into a royal family about five hundred years before the birth of Christ. A court astrologer said that Siddhartha would either be a world-conquering emperor or a world-changing guru.</p>\n<p>The clarification/insight side of meditation involves analyzing sensory experience into components and then tracking how those components interact. For example, if you are going through an emotional experience and want to practice meditation, you could decide to use a clarification meditation and, moment by moment, analyze your emotional experience in terms of basic sensory elements and their interactions.</p>\n<p><em>The three basic components of any emotional experience, then, are mental imagery, mental talk, and emotional-type body sensations. In order to have a quick way to describe things, I often refer to mental images as “See In,” mental talk as “Hear In,” and emotional-type body sensations as “Feel In.”</em></p>\n<p>Breaking a complex experience down into its components makes it easier to understand, thus giving us insight. It also divides up a difficult experience into smaller, less individually challenging pieces. And this makes it easier to cope with.</p>\n<p>When we apply concentration, clarity, and equanimity to sensory experience, moment by moment, we generate a process of insight and purification. Over time, this improves our lives, the lives of those around us, and the world in general. It can make dying bearable, even meaningful.</p>\n<p>When you think about it, all of human experience can be understood as sensory experience. That is, we only know about self and world through our senses. Recall that thought is sensory (mental image and mental talk) and emotions are sensory (mental image, mental talk, plus emotional body sensations).</p>\n<p>In the West, we tend to think that there are five senses, but in Buddhist theory, there are six. The six senses in Buddhist theory are hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, the feeling body, and the thinking mind.</p>\n<p>At some point, surface pictures and explicit words tend to die away. At that point, you begin to detect a subtle undercurrent, a sort of subterranean stirring in image space and talk space. That’s your subconscious mind! You don’t see explicit images or hear explicit words, but you know which part is visual and which part is auditory by its location.</p>\n<p>Embodied experience is a very complex phenomenon, but we can break it down into two main constituents: physical-type body sensation and emotional-type body sensation.</p>\n<p>These are the two basic qualitative categories of body sensations: physical and emotional.</p>\n<p>If we limit our consideration to just emotional-type body sensations, the most common flavors are anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, impatience, disgust, interest, joy, love, gratitude, humor, and smile.</p>\n<p>If you want to be happy independent of conditions, you’ll need to learn how to have a complete experience of each basic type of body sensation. On the spiritual path, we have to learn how to have a complete experience of anger, so that anger does not cause suffering which then distorts our behavior. For the same reason, we have to learn how to have a complete experience of fear, sadness, and so on. We even have to learn to have a complete experience of physical pain, as well as other unpleasant feelings in the body such as fatigue and nausea. When I say, “Have a complete experience of x,” it’s just a quick way of saying, “Experience x with so much concentration, clarity, and equanimity that there’s no time to coagulate x—or yourself—into a thing.” You and x become an integrated flow of energy and spaciousness.</p>\n<p>When we become skilled at tracking the subtleties of our internal sensory landscape, we can encounter our experience in a clearer way. Take for example the experience of anger. When you have an experience of anger, you have talk in your head: “He said such and such.” “How dare he do such and such.” “The next time he does such and such, I am going to do such and such.” “But what I would really like to do is such and such.” We hear words like these in our mental “talk space.” Meanwhile on the internal screen (the mind’s eye), there are pictures that go with these words. We might picture ourselves striking back or stalking off. Taken together, these internal words and pictures constitute the thought component of the anger experience. While these are going on, a tight quality is happening in the gut, a shaky quality is arising in the legs and spreading through the rest of the body, a hot quality is moving over the face and also spreading subtly over the rest of the body, and a pressured quality is arising in the chest. These feelings are the emotional-type body-sensation component of the anger experience. These three components of anger—mental image, mental talk, and emotional body sensations—often occur simultaneously. Without clarity, they become a tangled skein. Without equanimity, that tangled skein coagulates into a solid mass of congealed suffering. And what’s true of anger is true of all mind-body experience. If we develop an ability to discern the components of the experience, we can begin to keep track of what part is thought and what part is feeling.</p>\n<p><em>Such exacerbated suffering will often distort our response to a situation, leading to even more suffering. This is the essence of the vicious cycle that Buddhists refer to as samsara.</em></p>\n<p><em>The basic model for the mindfulness-based spiritual path is to take some type of experience and infuse it with a high degree of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. Concentration means to focus attention on just what you deem relevant. Sensory clarity involves discerning the components that constitute an experience and detecting their subtle essence. Equanimity means that we give permission for these components to expand, to contract, or to be still—to do whatever they naturally would do. Equanimity is a radical noninterference with the natural flow of our senses. In other words, we can take any type of experience and attempt to be focused, precise, and allowing with it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Concentration + Sensory clarity + Equanimity + Time = Insight + Purification</em></p>\n<p>We store influences from the past in the subconscious, those influences inappropriately affect our behavior and perception in the present, and our job is to somehow remove those distorting influences.</p>\n<p>Just as there are many facets to the insight process (prajna), there are many different ways in which we can talk about the purification process (vishuddhi). If you want to use a theological paradigm, you would say that purification is the working through of our sinfulness, gradually burning away what’s lodged between the surface self and the spiritual Source of self. For example, a form of meditation is practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church that is in some ways remarkably similar to mindfulness. It’s called nepsis (sober observation). It expresses the idea of purification using the Greek word catharsis, which means “cleansing.” It is a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church that we can cleanse away enough sinfulness to experience theosis, which means literally “becoming like God.” According to the Orthodox Church, theosis is the goal of human life.</p>\n<p>Ordinary experience, when greeted with concentration, clarity, and equanimity catalyzes a process of insight and purification which culminates in the ability to have complete experiences whenever you want.</p>\n<p>In early Buddhism, impermanence was closely linked with another concept, dukkha, which is usually translated as “suffering.” The Buddha said that human suffering is caused by grasping. One way grasping can cause us to suffer is when we pin our happiness on things that cannot and will not last. Most people depend solely on things like health, wealth, reputation, relationships, appearance, family, or children for happiness. The problem is that these things are not eternal. People change; our health eventually deteriorates; wealth comes and goes; war may follow peace. All sources of conditional happiness are impermanent. In the words of Ecclesiastes, “All things must pass.” If we make these impermanent things the cornerstone of our happiness, then we set ourselves up for inevitable suffering, or dukkha. So in early Buddhism, impermanence had a negative connotation. We suffer because we count on impermanent things for our happiness. We pin all hope of happiness on things that will not last.</p>\n<p>When we develop body mindfulness, we attempt to be very precise about the locations of sensations, and we try to have equanimity with them to the best of our ability. In essence, we take the ordinary aches and pains we experience while sitting, and convert them into a kind of acupuncture stimulus. As a result of pinpointing them and opening to them, they start to flow and vibrate, creating an experience analogous to the deqi of acupuncture.</p>\n<p>If equanimity is not deep, the intense See Out (physical sight) and the subtle See In (mental image) are both coagulated, and you have the ordinary experience of an I looking at an it. But if the See Out of the sand and the See In of visual association are not fixated, they become a single wave.</p>\n<p>We have talked about impermanence as sort of a pessimistic worldview, we have talked about impermanence as a characteristic of experience, and we have talked about impermanence as something that helps us along in our meditation. We have also talked about impermanence as an integrator that frees us from our fundamental alienation and connects us to the All.</p>\n<p>Just because the sense of self as a thing goes away does not for a moment imply that the activity of personality goes away. The enlightened people who constantly talk about no self often have strong, charismatic personalities. You might think that’s paradoxical, but it is a logical consequence of the experience of no self. It happens because the sense of self as something material has gone away, and all the energy that was bound up in that is now freed up for a fluid expression of personality.</p>\n<p>So enlightened people often have expressive, engaging, and charismatic personalities. That’s because their internal fluidity manifests as external spontaneity. They possess the doingness of self as opposed to being possessed by the somethingness of self.</p>\n<p>Practicing Just Note Gone is pretty straightforward. Whenever a sensory experience suddenly disappears, make a note of that fact: clearly acknowledge when you detect the transition point between all of it being present and at least some of it no longer being present. You can use the mental label “Gone” to help you note the end of the experience. If nothing vanishes for a while, that’s fine. Just hang out until something does. If you start worrying about the fact that nothing is ending, note each time that thought ends. There is only a finite amount of real estate available in consciousness at any given instant. Each arising somewhere causes a passing somewhere else.</p>\n<p>It’s also intuitively obvious that if you’re going through an uncomfortable experience, focusing on vanishings could bring microrelief. And it’s not a big stretch to imagine that, if your ability to continuously focus on Goneness is high, those moments of microrelief might sum to significant relief, macrorelief.</p>\n<p>Enlightenment is simply the ability to formulate a clear sensory representation of the formless state that immediately precedes each experience of form.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>In most of the companies I worked so far, we usually get a lot of interruptions. Everything is deemed important and our attention is stretched super thin between all kind of distractions. In the beginning it feels good, we are busy and we are being helpful, but after a while it gets exhausting. And the flow of requests never ends.</p>\n<p>One of the big issues with a large number of interruptions is that we are forced to make a lot of small decisions tens of times a day. Every time you get interrupted by an email or a person, you need to make a decision if you should pursue the request or not right away. And if you decide to pursue it, more decisions will be required. From a certain point of the day forward, you will be so exhausted by all these that you will either be driven by interruptions or make haste decisions that will make your future self unhappy. And this is called <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=decision+fatigue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decision fatigue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"see_the_interruptions\" tabindex=\"-1\">See the interruptions</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#see_the_interruptions\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “See the interruptions”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>They say that visualizing a problem, means to have it half solved already. So one big step in reducing the number of interruptions is to figure out how many you have and what type. Different types could be solved in different ways. If you have many of a certain type, those would be a good place to start eliminating some of your interruptions.</p>\n<p>If you have a strict process in place, this would as easy as pulling a report. But many times these interruptions usually get lost in the noise. Once you are aware that they exist and you want to track them down, this usually involves a change in process. &quot;Every time someone interrupts you, you should create a yellow sticky and put it on the board.&quot; Sometimes this works out if you have someone to keep reminding everyone to follow this procedure when an interruption appears indefinitely. Wouldn't it be great if we could build this in a habit?</p>\n<p>While I still have a large portion to read of <a href=\"http://charlesduhigg.com/books/the-power-of-habit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duhigg's habits book</a>, I know that in order to build or change a habit, you need to identify the 3 components of a habit: the trigger or the cue, the routine or the thing that should happen when triggered and the reward.</p>\n<p>Usually the routine is what you want to do out of habit, so in our case, to write a yellow sticky and put it on the board. But what would be the cue?</p>\n<p>The cue should be also pretty simple: either a physical person coming at your desk asking you to do something or an email with a similar request. And what about the reward?</p>\n<p>This is where the idea gets fuzzy. I couldn't really think of a reward that would be seen as a reward by everyone. What would work for me as a reward, is the fact that I am making steps towards eliminating interruptions which bring me frustration. Seeing that post-it on the board gives me hope that sometime soon we will take measures to eliminate this waste of time and energy spent on switching context and potentially on tasks completely void of value.</p>\n<p>Once you gather all these post-its, make time weekly or daily, whatever works for you, to go through them, group them and choose simple actions to prevent or avoid them. Start with the large groups, there might be very simple solutions which could have a big impact.</p>\n<p>I think it's very important to make a commitment to improve things based on the findings. Not taking any action as a result of gathering all these post-its is one of the main reasons this habit doesn't usually stick, in my opinion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limit_email_and_chat\" tabindex=\"-1\">Limit email and chat</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#limit_email_and_chat\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Limit email and chat”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Handling email and chat messages as they come, can severely damage your productivity. So unless your job requires you to answer emails asap, and very few jobs require that, I suggest you to form some very simple habits to handle this kind of interruptions.</p>\n<p>First make sure your email and chat clients are closed when you start your day. Print a paper that says &quot;Close email and chat&quot; and put it next to your desk in a place that is easy for you to see. That should serve as a cue to close your mail and chat (routine). The reward is the ability to be focused on whatever task is important to you.</p>\n<p>Now you'll probably won't get away without answering char or email at all during the day. So why don't you choose the moment to do that? Define 1 or 2 intervals during the day when you will focus only on that and block them in your calendar. The calendar reminder will serve as a trigger and answering emails or chats is the actual routine. The reward is pretty sweet: reaching email nirvana, 0 unread emails in your inbox!</p>\n",

Mentorship technique corresponds to the Social Drive (#5).</p>\n<p>I've met very few companies where having a mentor is common practice. This is not something you can enforce, maybe not everyone is good to be a mentor and they shouldn't, but I think mentorship should be encouraged as a practice.

(S)he can teach you a few things about the culture of the company and how things work in certain situations. Going along with your mentor in some meetings can help you make connections faster and feel part of the group. All this is to make you, the new kid on the block, feel welcomed and make sure you adapt fast and in a more pleasant way to the rigours of the company.</p>\n<p>Many times there are new employees who never really get along with the company culture and dogma, but nobody really notices. Some don't feel at home but don't have anybody they could safely talk about their problems fitting in. How many of them would feel safe to bring it up with their manager, who approves their salary and gets to decide if they stay or leave at the end of the probation period?</p>\n<p>A mentor could try to address some of the issues and also encourage him/her to discuss these with someone who can help.

But isn't that a pity for the company to loose all that experience in your field and more importantly in how the company works? I still remember when in one of my previous jobs they had to request the help of a person who left a few months before, because they simply couldn't figure out some very important things he used to handle. He accumulated so much information and responsibilities over the years, that it was impossible to hand over everything in the notice period.</p>\n<p>One way to keep some of the most experienced ones around is to encourage them to mentor less experienced people, who are maybe just getting started in their career. The mentees will feel grateful for the chance of learning from an expert and for the support they receive and the mentors will be given a different purpose to come to work every day and be a integral part of your company.</p>\n<p>It is said there are few greater joys in life than the moment when the mentee exceeds his/her mentor.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>After reading in the <a href=\"http://charlesduhigg.com/books/the-power-of-habit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Power of Habit</a> about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7waGhujn44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how militaries</a> or football coaches use habits to train their soldiers or players to react fast in the field, I started wondering how much of this science we could use in our everyday “pencil-pushing” or “keyboard-smashing” knowledge work?</p>\n<p>As Charles Duhigg puts it, a habit consists of three important elements: a cue, a routine and a reward. On top of that, you need a craving to drive the loop cue-routine-reward to repeat itself. Identifying all these elements is very important for creating but also breaking (bad) habits.</p>\n<p>So you might wonder, how would all this help us with the work we do in the office?</p>\n<p>I think our work but also our life in general could benefit in two ways from understanding how habits work:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1_identify_and_break_bad_habits\" tabindex=\"-1\">1. Identify and break bad habits</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1_identify_and_break_bad_habits\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “1. Identify and break bad habits”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I’m sure you were many times in the situation where you did something and you regreted it afterwards. Ever had a glass of wine too much? Or eaten a bit more than needed? What about checking your phone repeatedly or maybe writing emails during meetings? Have you jumped the gun and immediately agreed to something that you had doubts about just because you were too tired to say no?</p>\n<p>All these could be seen as bad habits that you might want to avoid in the future. It seems that it is quite difficult to break a habit. Even when the results could be harmful for us. Once the habit was formed, it is there to stay forever. One way to break the habit would be to prevent the cue from happening, which implies that the habit never gets triggered. But most cues are deeply ingrained into our daily life and cannot be avoided. According to Duhigg, the best way to change a habit is to keep the old cue and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.</p>\n<p>So when hunger strikes (cue), instead of eating a lot of protein and carbs (old routine), eat more veggies or simply less (new routine) and you will feel full (reward), without the food coma and extra kilos afterwards. Or when you feel bored in a meeting (cue), instead of checking your phone for notifications or writing some email that was hanging in your to do list (old routine), just to get your dopamine levels up and feel you did something (reward), while maybe missing important details or simply waste time, try to be more involved and steer the conversation in a useful direction or ask to end it early, which would in the end give you the same feeling you achieved something.</p>\n<p>Same cue, same reward, different routine, better results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2_create_new_useful_habits_that_would_make_your_work_and_life_easier\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Create new useful habits that would make your work and life easier</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2_create_new_useful_habits_that_would_make_your_work_and_life_easier\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “2. Create new useful habits that would make your work and life easier”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Many people are late to meetings many times not because they cannot physically get to the place they’re expected to be at a certain time, but because they forget or they get carried away with something else. One useful habit would be to have some sort of reminder like a specific sound or image (cue), when you drop whatever you are doing (routine) and get to the meeting on time or early and feel good about it, especially useful in cultures where punctuality is a thing (reward).</p>\n<p>I think habits can also help us avoid <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decision fatigue</a> or react better when reaching it. If you could identify common decisions that you often have to make and tie them with a cue, routine and reward, so you make those decisions without really spending energy on them, you save some of that magic juice for the really important decisions. And if you are tired, try to identify a cue for this state and associate a routine and a reward that will prevent you from making rushed or bad choices.</p>\n<p>These are some of the ideas that came into my mind while reading Charles Duhigg book. And I realise again how important self-awareness is in our life and how many more things I have to learn.</p>\n",

So what does it mean to <em>not</em> micro-manage people? It means giving them the autonomy they need to do their job in the best way they consider doing it. They are the experts, so what you need to do is give them everything they need in order to do a great job and stay out of their way. In return, you will get more time to do your own stuff and they will be more motivated, which will lead to more great work from their part. Sounds like a winning formula, right?</p>\n<p>But what are the major things someone needs in order to be autonomous in his/her work?</p>\n<p>From my experience, here are the 2 major things that make <em>me</em> feel autonomous at work:</p>\n<h2 id=\"perspective\" tabindex=\"-1\">Perspective</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#perspective\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Perspective”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Make sure you’re clear about <em>what</em> you are trying to achieve and <em>why</em>.</p>\n<p><em>What</em> is the guiding star for your employees, it’s the end result expected from their work, it’s what they need to achieve using their expert skills. If you don’t come up with a vision of <em>what</em> you’re trying to achieve, then you’re gonna have to spoon feed them every little step, every little task that they need to do in order to get to what you have in your mind. And that’s gonna be painful for both of you. Many times is not easy to define and explain what you want to achieve, but it is necessary, unless you want to do everything yourself or get completely different results than what you expect.</p>\n<p><em>Why</em> is needed there because you want to get buy-in for your grand vision and motivate even more by giving the sense of purpose (one of the other 2 elements of true motivation). While on the short term it might seem convenient for the <em>why</em> to be a consistent amount of money, especially when you have them, that will not last. You are not rich enough to keep that <em>why</em> attractive on a long term and probably you don’t want people who are motivated only by money to work for you. Maybe only if you’re a bank or an investment fund or a stock market, but even then, weren’t money incentives the ones that contributed a lot to the 2008 crisis?</p>\n<h2 id=\"environment_of_trust\" tabindex=\"-1\">Environment of trust</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#environment_of_trust\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Environment of trust”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>So by now you shared your vision and your why, next you need to make sure there is the right environment in place for your people to get you there. And that is mainly relying on creating a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relationship of trust</a>. They need to trust you, you need to trust them and they need to trust each other. If you don’t treat your people as experts and adults and you filter or withhold information: no trust. If through some reward mechanisms you make people compete against each other: no trust. If you are not aware of the impact of some of your actions and only blame your employees for the poor results: no trust again.</p>\n<p>This has huge implications to the entire dynamics of the workplace, not just to how autonomous people feel they are. From trust emerge transparency, safety to be yourself and to make mistakes, possibility to learn from those mistakes, and many more. All these contribute to the general <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/03/great-companies-obsess-over-productivity-not-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">productivity</a> of your people and the quality of their life at work but also at home. And these value more than any ludicrous financial rewards!</p>\n",

Caleb has a grand vision for the product that he is responsible for in the company. It is a vision that will probably never see the light of day exactly in the shape he imagines it right now, but maybe somewhere along the lines. In order to make this vision happen, Caleb works closely together with Dave, the tech lead of the development team.</p>\n<p>Dave also has a vision, a technical and architectural vision that would enable Caleb’s product vision in a good and reliable way. Dave didn’t come up with the technical vision on his own, it was based on good technical practices and the business environment but also on the feedback that resulted from brainstorming with the whole development team. The entire development team understands and recognises the business value of the product vision and contributed to and feels responsible for the technical vision.</p>\n<p>Now while Caleb would never admit it, he got a few very good ideas from the team as well. They are all convinced they are doing the right things in the right way and even if they will be proven wrong (although these things are rarely black or white) there will be things they will all learn from it and apply them in the next iterations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scenario_2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scenario 2</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#scenario_2\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Scenario 2”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Caleb is a product owner which works with a software development team in a successful product company. Caleb has a grand vision for the product that he is responsible for in the company. It is a vision that will probably never see the light of day exactly in the shape he imagines it right now, but maybe somewhere along the lines. In order to make this vision happen, Caleb needs to work with Dave, the tech lead of the development team. Caleb finds it difficult to work with Dave and the dev team, it seems like they are always complaining about things, they never agree with him and he feels that he always has to push them from behind to deliver. They don’t get his vision and don’t seem to be that positive in general.</p>\n<p>Dave and the team have infinite discussions about the technical stuff but they cannot seem to agree on what would be the best long term approach. They understand Caleb’s vision and the business value it has, but something doesn’t fell right. It seems too ambitious and in the way the company is moving, it will never get done. Plus, they are swamped with all kind of small changes that are hardly related with any vision. It’s just work that comes their way and they have to do it, because someone decided so and gets pushed to them through Caleb.</p>\n<p>As Caleb, Dave also has a technical vision on how to architect and design the services that support the product vision, but they hardly have time to make significant steps towards it. Many things they release generate technical debt which will slow them down in the next releases. In several occasions they had to simply stop whatever they were doing, fix some major failure, bring the systems back floating and then resume. Although they have retros and they take all kind of action points to improve things, the situation doesn’t seem to change that much. And nobody gets what’s the point with these visions if they never get done!</p>\n<p><em>What do you think? What’s the difference between them? Which one would you like to be in?</em></p>\n",

It either says something about you or your work, or something about your boss, or all of them.</p>\n<p>First of all, congratulations if you ask yourself questions about your performance and how is perceived by others, it means you at least have some intent of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-you-fix-colleagues-who-arent-self-aware-daniel-goleman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-awareness</a>. Many people react to being micro-managed by blindly complying to the boss’ nagging requests, getting frustrated, which leads to poor work, which leads to more micro-managing, which probably leads to being fired or simply decide to go somewhere else.</p>\n<p>After getting through similar situations a few times, I found the courage and took the boss to a short conversation, <em>“Hey, listen, I noticed recently you are requesting a lot of status updates and details about my work, is there something wrong?”</em>. Now there might be situations where the answer to this question is not a pleasant one, but most of the time it is somewhere along the lines of <em>”You have been late delivering stuff several times, kept promising and then delaying, the customer is upset!”</em> or <em>”I’ve had so much work to do recently and so many things at the same time, I feel like I’m loosing control of the deliveries!”</em>.</p>\n<p>The first version tells you that you might be a bit too optimistic about your estimates or you can’t say no enough, which is valid feedback and an opportunity for you to learn, while the second says a bit more about your boss than about yourself. Regardless, nothing an open conversation and some change in behaviour cannot solve. But, like with all problems, you first have to realise there’s a problem and then act - talk to your boss - (not just instinctively react) in order to try and fix it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_capable_people_do_i_have_to_do_everything_myself\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why is it so hard to find capable people?

Most of the people I met really want to do a great job. And even if they wouldn’t, micro-managing them is not the answer. They will never learn better and you will be always busy controlling everyone, rather than focusing on doing what is important for you.</p>\n<p>Regardless on which side of the micro-managing you are looking from, the problem has a similar solution: first realise you are in one of the positions described above (maybe the toughest part, self-awareness) and second, go have a conversation with the other person involved.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, state how you feel about the situation (<em>“I am really frustrated because I feel micro-managed”</em> or <em>“I am worried that the delivery is not going to get back on track”</em>) and then ask what could be the reason of that and if you could do something to change it. And then listen.</p>\n<p>Don’t assume things about the other and don’t make a big deal out of it and certainly don’t continue in the same way if you feel something is wrong.</p>\n",

It is still not 100% clear for me how someone gets in the box in the workplace, but I can definitely recognise the situation where one would throw trash at the company, without a clear understanding of why and what is the actual problem. It is easier to throw trash at something or someone else than criticising yourself. And while blaming the others, you make yourself look better in your eyes, you justify your failure, “it’s because of the environment, it’s because of the world and the others”.</p>\n<p>I think it would’ve been great if the authors spent a bit more time coming with examples of “getting in the box” at the workplace. I feel that while the story of Bud and his wife when they had a little child is quite clear and relatable, the stories related to Tom and how he got to be in the box at work are not very clear or representative to the challenges you would have in the office.</p>\n<p>One of the most valuable lessons for me is to think twice when I try to criticise or throw blame towards somebody, anybody, either at work or at home. What does that blaming do for me? Does it put me in a better light somehow, does it justify some of my actions? Then maybe, there’s something useful to learn about myself in that situation. The tricky part is to catch yourself with the intent of blaming and turning it around and put a mirror on your actions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes_&amp;_highlights\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notes &amp; Highlights</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#notes_&amp;_highlights\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Notes &amp; Highlights”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Self-deception is like this. It blinds us to the true causes of problems, and once we’re blind, all the “solutions” we can think of will actually make matters worse.</p>\n<p>“Self-betrayal”:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;1. An act contrary to what I feel I should do for another is called an act of “self-betrayal.” \n\n2. When I betray myself, I begin to see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal. \n\n3. When I see the world in a self-justifying way, my view of reality becomes distorted. \n\n4. So—when I betray myself, I enter the box. \n\n5. Over time, certain boxes become characteristic of me, and I carry them with me. \n\n6. By being in the box, I provoke others to be in the box. \n\n7. In the box, we invite mutual mistreatment and obtain mutual justification. We collude in giving each other reason to stay in the box.\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The more people we can find to agree with our side of the story, the more justified we will feel in believing that side of the story.</p>\n<p>When we’re in the box, what motivates us most is the need for justification, and what will bring us justification is very often at odds with what is best for the organization.</p>\n<p>Out of the box, my what-focus at work is results. In the box, by contrast, my what-focus is justification.</p>\n<p>You’re right that the people at work aren’t betraying themselves quite this way—no one is failing to tend to a baby. However, a lot of people are failing to do things for coworkers that they feel they should do, and they feel justified every time that happens, just like in this example. Every time we betray ourselves, we go in the box, and it doesn’t matter whether we betray ourselves at home, at work, at the store, or wherever. The box — self-deception — will itself cause all the same kinds of problems in every one of those situations that it caused in this one.</p>\n<p>There’s a particular self-betrayal that almost everyone engages in at work to one degree or another, a self-betrayal concerning the very purpose of what we were hired to do — to focus on helping the organization and its people to achieve results. The key to solving most of the people problems that afflict organizations is in discovering how we can solve this central workplace self-betrayal.</p>\n<p>An in-the-box organization is filled with people who are focused on themselves and on being justified. Imagine, in contrast, an organization where everyone is focused on others and on achieving results.</p>\n<p>The culture of blame that is so prevalent in organizations is replaced with a culture of deep responsibility-taking and accountability.</p>\n<p>Don’t give up on yourself when you discover you’ve been in the box. Do keep trying. Don’t deny that you’ve been in the box when you have been. Do apologize; then just keep marching forward, trying to be more helpful to others in the future. Don’t focus on what others are doing wrong. Do focus on what you can do right to help. Don’t worry whether others are helping you. Do worry whether you are helping others.</p>\n<p>The most effective leaders lead in this single way: by holding themselves more accountable than all.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Dust has settled on my blog lately. Writing stuff for the Internet is not my priority, no matter how much I enjoy it. I did decide to try something though: to briefly write about interesting things I found out every month. Like a newsletter about nothing and about everything, a mixed bag of new and old things I think are worth sharing. So here it is: <em>Interesting!</em>, Nov’16 edition!</p>\n<h2 id=\"contents\" tabindex=\"-1\">Contents</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#contents\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Contents”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><pre><code>  * Octalysis, an actionable gamification framework\n  * Self-deception and why it is so important for leaders and not only\n  * Cynefin (pronounced _ku-nev-in_) framework for decision making\n  * Slickyboards and Slickynotes, cheap convenient alternative for home whiteboards and static post-its\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"games_and_what_can_we_learn_from_why_we_play_them\" tabindex=\"-1\">Games and what can we learn from why we play them</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#games_and_what_can_we_learn_from_why_we_play_them\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Games and what can we learn from why we play them”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Understanding what motivates people to do things is a pretty interesting problem. The solution to this problem has many many many applications. But I am anticipating myself.</p>\n<p>One of the books <a href=\"https://www.alexchiri.com/post/actionable-gamification-beyond-points-badges-and-leaderboards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I finished reading</a> recently is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards/dp/1511744049\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Actionable Gamification - Beyond Points, Badges, and Leaderboards by Yu-Kai Chou</a>.</p>\n<p>Yu-Kai spent quite some trying to understand why people choose to spend so much time playing (computer) games, which bring no apparent long-term benefits, and find it much harder to dedicate time for more important things, like learning or improving themselves or their lives. Being a gamer himself who spent quite a lot of time inside games, he knew first hand how addictive they can be and thought to try to apply the same principles from games to improve his life (Lifestyle Gamification). And so he started working on the Octalysis framework, a collection of eight core drives which he put together in time while getting inspiration from existing research or from his own experiments.</p>\n<p>Yu-Kai’s framework can be used when designing products, workplaces, marketing campaigns or anything that involves people, to create a better experience for the type of users it targets and for the different stage they are in interacting with the product.</p>\n<p>What I find really interesting is how you can take these concepts and explain why certain users react in certain ways to all kind of applications or games. You can use the same concepts to design a better experience for your life or improve your workplace. It is definitely something worth checking out and learn from it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"it_looks_like_we_are_not_always_truthful_with_ourselves…_that_can’t_be_true\" tabindex=\"-1\">It looks like we are not always truthful with ourselves… that can’t be true!</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#it_looks_like_we_are_not_always_truthful_with_ourselves…_that_can’t_be_true\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “It looks like we are not always truthful with ourselves… that can’t be true!”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One book that I started reading and I already feel confident to share it with you is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GUPYRUS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box by The Arbinger Institute</a>. It is written like a story which makes it quite easy to read. The description on its Amazon page describes much better than I would ever be able to:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;Through a story everyone can relate to about a man facing challenges on the job and in his family, the authors expose the fascinating ways that we can blind ourselves to our true motivations and unwittingly sabotage the effectiveness of our own efforts to achieve success and increase happiness. \n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don’t think there is an adult person on Earth who cannot identify himself with some of the things lived by the main character in the book, which makes it have quite an impact on its readers. Of course, as with all the self-help books, knowing about it is one thing, being aware when it happens to you is a totally different thing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you_have_problems_check_out_this_framework\" tabindex=\"-1\">You have problems? Check out this framework!</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#you_have_problems_check_out_this_framework\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “You have problems? Check out this framework!”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>After spending hours in endless discussions about application design where we jump from one topic to another without getting anywhere actually, I started looking around (on Google) thinking that there must be a structured approach for solving these kind of problems. And that’s how I found out about the Cynefin framework which sparked my interest. I’ll let its creator, Dave Snowden, to briefly present it to you in the video below:</p>\n<p>I also found a free InfoQ mini-book about Cynefin which gets into some of the details of its concepts: <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/resource/minibooks/cynefin-mini-book/en/pdf/The-Cynefin-Mini-book-online.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.infoq.com/resource/minibooks/cynefin-mini-book/en/pdf/The-Cynefin-Mini-book-online.pdf</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"how_about_a_cheap_whiteboard_for_your_home_office_read_below\" tabindex=\"-1\">How about a cheap whiteboard for your home office? Read below</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how_about_a_cheap_whiteboard_for_your_home_office_read_below\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “How about a cheap whiteboard for your home office? Read below”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I found out about these babies some time ago and I thought, “hey! what a brilliant idea!”. Sheets of plastic which are charged with static energy and this way stick to pretty much any plain surface. You can write on them using your regular whiteboard markers and then erase them as you would do with a normal whiteboard. Pretty neat, right? You can watch them in action below:</p>\n<p>You can get them from <a href=\"http://www.neuland.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neuland</a>, pretty much anywhere in the world. While neuland seems to carry the Slickynotes, it doesn’t seem to have the original Slickyboards, but another product which behaves the same, so make sure you search for “static film sheets” on their regional website to find these wonderful things.</p>\n",

I noticed that I cannot read always non-fiction, because it is usually harder to digest, so I only do that in the morning (usually in the subway ride to work) when my mind is fresh.</p>\n<p>At the same time, if I only read non-fiction, I feel like I am always thinking about the things I am reading and my mind doesn’t get to disconnect. This affects how well I get to focus on the reading. So I thought of making a habit in reading fiction in the evenings and non-fiction in the mornings. It is not very important how much I read every day, as long as I keep on going (<a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">don’t break the chain</a>).</p>\n<p>If you’ll check out my <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/alexchiri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goodreads</a> profile, you’ll most likely see I have two books that I am currently reading:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-05%20at%2017.30.41.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"so_many_details\" tabindex=\"-1\">So many details</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so_many_details\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “So many details”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Because there are a lot of useful details in the books I read, which I fail to recall most of the time, I found useful to take notes. I tried all kind of approaches for this, but the one that seems to work best for me is using the Kindle apps for phone or tablet and highlighting the bits I like. Selection is too laggy on e-ink readers and I waste too much time on trying to get all the paragraphs I want selected.</p>\n<p>When I finish the book, I export the notes and highlights from my Kindle account and put them in a blog post for sharing, but mostly for my later reference.</p>\n<p>There’s one script I find useful to export the Kindle notes which is called <a href=\"http://www.norbauer.com/bookcision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bookcision</a>. It’s a bookmark with some JavaScript code that you should run on <a href=\"https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Kindle page with the book notes</a> and voilà!: easy exporting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bonus_podcasts\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bonus: podcasts</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#bonus_podcasts\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Bonus: podcasts”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Another good source of information is podcasts, there are so many great out there. Unlike other people, I cannot focus on audio books or podcasts while commuting or driving. I focus much better on reading. So I was a little bit behind with my listening, until I had the idea to listen to podcasts while working out in the gym, one day per week. I do my training almost on auto-pilot and it’s usually quiet, so I can focus on the listening. For the more dense podcasts, I take notes between sets in my phone, notes that I also put on my blog.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/IMG_3845.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

I think it makes sense and can be applied in pretty much anything related to people.<br>\nThe book has A LOT of well known examples which makes it easier to understand the basics.</p>\n<p>I find it pretty difficult to internalize the meaning and the effects of the core drives, especially when combined. Probably because I didn't do all the exercises at the end of the chapters, which are destined to make you understand the concepts by applying them to your own problems and experience.</p>\n<p>It's good to have the book close by as a reference so you can go back to different chapters whenever you need to refresh terms or ideas. An index would've served very well for this, unfortunately, at least in the Kindle version, the book doesn't have one.</p>\n<p>I plan to do the <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/gamification-behavioral-design-the-octalysis-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design: The Octalysis Frameworok</a> course on Udemy (already started) and also the <a href=\"http://join.yukaichou.com/21-day-gamification-course/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">21-day Gamification Course</a> that Yukai provides on his website. All this to consolidate the knowledge I got from reading the book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notes</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#notes\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Notes”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Five conclusions that led to hobbies being more preferable to work (Charles Coonradt):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly defined goals</li>\n<li>Better scorekeeping and scorecards</li>\n<li>More frequent feedback</li>\n<li>A higher degree of personal choice of methods</li>\n<li>Consistent coaching</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gamification is the craft of deriving fun and engaging elements found typically in games and thoughtfully applying them to real-world or productive activities.</p>\n<p>Human-Focused Design optimizes for human motivation in a system as opposed to optimizing for pure functional efficiency within the system.</p>\n<p>Games have no other purpose than to please the humans playing them.</p>\n<p>Grunt work takes on a new meaning when understood as an affect of powerful motivational factors. This is the promise and vision that good gamification design can create.</p>\n<p>Many gamification professionals seem to believe that if you put points on something boring, add some badges, and provide a competitive leaderboard, that once boring product will automatically become exciting.</p>\n<p>The Core Drives</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is the Core Drive that is in play when a person believes they are doing something greater than themselves and/or were “chosen” to take that action.</li>\n<li>Development &amp; Accomplishment is our internal drive for making progress, developing skills, achieving mastery, and eventually overcoming challenges.</li>\n<li>Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new things out and try different combinations.</li>\n<li>Ownership &amp; Possession is where users are motivated because they feel like they own or control something.</li>\n<li>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: mentorship, social acceptance, social feedback, companionship, and even competition and envy.</li>\n<li>Scarcity &amp; Impatience is the Core Drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare, exclusive, or immediately unattainable.</li>\n<li>Unpredictability is the Core Drive of constantly being engaged because you don’t know what is going to happen next.</li>\n<li>Loss &amp; Avoidance This Core Drive should come as no surprise – it’s the motivation to avoid something negative from happening.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these 8 Core Drives have different natures within them. Some make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency, while others create urgency, obsession, and even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some are more long-term intrinsically focused.</p>\n<p>The Octalysis Framework is arranged so that the Core Drives that focus on creativity, self-expression, and social dynamics are organized on the right side of the octagon =&gt; Right Brain Core Drives. The Core Drives that are most commonly associated with logic, analytical thought, and ownership are graphed on the left side of the Octagon and are termed Left Brain Core Drives.</p>\n<p>Another factor to note within the Octalysis Framework is that the top Core Drives in the octagon are considered very positive motivations (White Hat), while the bottom Core Drives are considered to be more negative (Black Hat).</p>\n<p>If something is engaging because it lets you express your creativity, makes you feel successful through skill mastery, and gives you a higher sense of meaning, it makes you feel very good and powerful. On the other hand, if you are always doing something because you don’t know what will happen next, you are constantly in fear of losing something, or because you’re struggling to attain things you can’t have, the experience will often leave a bad taste in your mouth- even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions.</p>\n<p>Once one has achieved mastery in Level I Octalysis, they can then apply it to Level II Octalysis, where we try to optimize experiences throughout all four phases of the player/user journey. These phases are: Discovery (why people would even want to try out the experience), Onboarding (where users learn the rules and tools to play the game), Scaffolding (the regular journey of repeated actions towards a goal) and Endgame (how do you retain your veterans).</p>\n<p>Richard Bartle’s Four Player Types: Achievers, Socializers, Explorers, and Killers</p>\n<p>Types of Gamification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explicit Gamification involves strategies that utilize applications that are obviously game-like. Users acknowledge they are playing a game, and generally need to opt into playing.</li>\n<li>Implicit Gamification is a form of design that subtly employs gamification techniques and the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis into the user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gamification requires sophisticated design to actually be effective and create a long lasting relationship between the player and the game maker.</p>\n<p>Examples of Gamification applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Gamification is about making a product, online or offline, more engaging, fun, and inspirational through game design.</li>\n<li>Workplace Gamification is the craft of creating environments and systems that inspire and motivate employees towards their work.</li>\n<li>Marketing Gamification is the art of creating holistic marketing campaigns that engage users in fun and unique experience designed for a product, service, platform, or brand.</li>\n<li>Lifestyle Gamification</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is the First Core Drive of Octalysis Gamification. This is the drive where people are motivated because they believe they are engaged in something bigger than themselves.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, it’s not about what you want as an individual nor about what makes you feel good. Individuals participate in the system and take action not because it necessarily benefits them, but because they can then see themselves as heroes of a grander story. It’s about playing your part for the greater good.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is generally best communicated during the Discovery and Onboarding Phase of a Player’s Journey.</p>\n<p>The powerful thing about Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, is that it turns otherwise passive users into powerful evangelists of your mission</p>\n<p><em>Narrative (Game Technique #10)</em> Most games start with a narrative that gives the player some context about why they should play the game. One of the more effective ways to instill Epic Meaning &amp; Calling into your user base is through an engaging Narrative.</p>\n<p><em>Humanity Hero (Game Technique #27)</em>: If you can incorporate a world mission into your offerings, you can gain even more buy-in during the Onboarding process.</p>\n<p><em>Elitism (Game Technique #26)</em>: Allowing your users or customers to form a prideful group based on ethnicity, beliefs, or common interests also makes them feel like they are part of a larger cause.</p>\n<p><em>Beginner’s Luck (Game Technique #23)</em>: Beginner’s Luck focuses on the Calling part in Epic Meaning &amp; Calling. Calling makes people think they are uniquely destined to do something.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is the prime White Hat Core Drive within the Octalysis Framework, and is often very powerful in the Discovery and Onboarding Phases of a player’s journey.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling’s weakness lies in the difficulty of implementing believability, as well as the lack of urgency within the motivation.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment: This is the Core Drive where people are driven by a sense of growth and a need to accomplish a targeted goal. It is what focuses us on a career path, generates our enthusiasm and commitment to learning a new skill, and ultimately motivates us by showing us how far we’ve come and how much we’ve grown.</p>\n<p>Our brains have a natural desire to achieve goals and to experience growth in order to feel that real progress in life is being made. We need Win-States.</p>\n<p>The key to Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment is to make sure users are proud of overcoming the challenges that are set out for them.</p>\n<p>Jane McGonigal, renowned game designer and Ph.D. in Performance Studies, defines games as “unnecessary obstacles that we volunteer to tackle.” McGonigal points out that challenges and limitations are what make a game fun.</p>\n<p><em>“Torture Break” (Game Technique #66)</em>, where a user must wait an interval of time regardless of their actions, a game technique to be explored under Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience.</p>\n<p>Studies on Trust and Reputation in Peer-to-Peer Networks by researchers like Yao Wang and Julita Vassileva of the University of Saskatchewan, as well as Minaxi Gupta, Paul Judge, and Mostafa Ammar of the Georgia Institute of Technology found that the average consumer prefers and trusts reviews by peers over those by professional critics.</p>\n<p>Beyond improving one’s ranks and obtaining badges, a very important type of emotional accomplishment is to “feel smart.” We all like to feel capable and competent, and feelings of being incompetent or powerless can create some of the most scarring moments of our lives.</p>\n<p>Feeling a sense of progress and ultimately losing is much better than feeling stuck and confused.</p>\n<p><em>Desert Oasis (Game Technique #38)</em>, where visually nothing else is prominent besides the main Desired Action. The Desert Oasis looks green and juicy and it subconsciously suggests that there is a Win-State behind this option.</p>\n<p><em>Progress Bars (Game Technique #4)</em> One of the simplest and best known examples of Development &amp; Accomplishment is the LinkedIn Progress Bar.</p>\n<p>Achievement Symbols merely reflect achievement, but are not achievements by themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Status Points (Game Technique #1)</em>: There are two types of points in a motivation system: Status Points, and Exchangeable Points. Status Points are for keeping score of progress. Internally, it allows the system to know how close players are towards the win-state.</p>\n<p>During the Discovery and Onboarding Phases of a Player’s Journey (the initial two phases) the first thing you want to communicate to users is whether this is “a game worth playing?” With the rules you set, you are establishing an interaction with the user and communicating your values.</p>\n<p>When you design your Status Point systems, make sure it is based on something meaningful - something that the users themselves want to engage in. Or else, points just become meaningless counters meant to stress people out.</p>\n<p><em>Leaderboards (Game Technique #3)</em>: Leaderboards is a game element where you rank users based on a set of criteria that is influenced by the users’ behaviors towards the Desired Actions.</p>\n<p>What users need is Urgent Optimism, another term coined by Jane McGonigal, where the user feels optimistic that they can accomplish the task, but also the urgency to act immediately.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 3 Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback: When a user can continuously tap into their creativity and derive an almost limitless number of possibilities, the game designer no longer needs to constantly create new content to make things engaging. The user’s mind becomes the evergreen content that continuously absorbs their attention into the experience.</p>\n<p>When you design a great gamified system, you want to make sure that there isn’t one standard way to win. Instead, provide users with enough meaningful choices that they can utilize drastically different ways to better express their creativity, while still achieving the Win-State.</p>\n<p>When you design for Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, it is important to create a setup where the user is given a goal, as well as a variety of tools and methodologies to strategize towards reaching that goal.</p>\n<p>In the Motivational Psychology Bestseller Drive, Daniel Pink explains that allowing employees to have full autonomy over what they work on, how they work, who they work with, and when they work often becomes greater motivators than giving them a raise.</p>\n<p><em>Boosters (Game Technique #31)</em>: A player obtains something to help them achieve the win-state effectively.</p>\n<p><em>Poison Picker/Choice Perception (Game Technique #89)</em>: Many studies have shown that people like something more when they are given a choice, compared to simply having one option. This holds true even if the multiple options are not as appealing compared to the single choice. The key to the Choice Perception is that the choice itself is not necessarily meaningful, but merely makes a person feel like they are empowered to choose between different paths and options.</p>\n<p><em>Plant Picker/Meaningful Choices (Game Technique #11)</em>: Beyond choices that allow people to feel like they are empowered, there are choices that are truly meaningful and demonstrates preferences that are not obviously superior over others.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is a great Core Drive on many different levels. It taps into our innate desire to create, by providing us the tools and power to direct our own gameplay and giving us the ability to affect the environment around us through our own imaginations.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 3 is more commonly seen effective in the Scaffolding and Endgame Phases, as opposed to the Discovery and Onboarding Phases.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 4 Ownership &amp; Possession: it represents the motivation that is driven by our feelings of owning something, and consequently the desire to improve, protect, and obtain more of it.</p>\n<p>Once you feel a sense of ownership over something, its status elevates and it begins to motivate your behavior differently.</p>\n<p>One caveat to the Endowment Effect is, if the person owns something as a token “for exchange,” they will not feel attached to the item in a biased manner.</p>\n<p>Science has shown that the longer we live, the more attached we become to our existing beliefs, preferences, methodologies, and even our own names.</p>\n<p>Stemming from the attachment to our own identities is the need to behave consistently with our past actions. Dan Ariely describes this as self-herding, where we believe something is good (or bad) on the basis of our previous behavior.</p>\n<p><em>Build-From-Scratch (Game Technique #43)</em>: When you create a product or service, it is often desirable for your users to increase their vested ownership in the process of its creation.</p>\n<p><em>Collection Sets (Game Technique #16)</em>: One of the most powerful and effective ways to utilize Core Drive 4: Ownership and Possession is through Collection Sets. Say you give people a few items, characters, or badges, and you tell them that this is part of a collection set that follows a certain theme. This creates a desire in them to collect all the elements and complete the set.</p>\n<p>If the system no longer rewards the appropriate labor with the commensurate perceived value, then the economy loses its legitimacy.</p>\n<p><em>Monitor Attachment (Game Technique #42)</em>: Monitor Attachment is a game technique that allows people to develop more ownership towards something, such that they are constantly monitoring or paying attention to it.</p>\n<p><em>The Alfred Effect (Game Technique #83)</em>: The Alfred Effect is when users feel that a product or service is so personalized to their own needs that they cannot imagine using another service.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession is a powerful motivator that can attract us to do many irrational things, but could also give us great emotional comfort and a sense of well-being.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 5 Social Influence &amp; Relatedness involves activities inspired by what other people think, do, or say. This Core Drive is the engine behind many themes such as mentorship, competition, envy, group quests, social treasure, and companionship.</p>\n<p>Because you feel that you are part of a larger group, you need to behave like people who are in that group – it’s a cause beyond yourself, even if your group will never find out what you have done. The action, or inaction, calls your integrity into question.</p>\n<p><em>Mentorship (Game Technique #61)</em>: Having a mentor helps employees better connect with the culture and environment in the workplace. This can effectively increase overall work satisfaction and lower turnover rates. The other benefit for Mentorship is that it also helps veteran players stay engaged during the Endgame Phase. In the Four Experience Phases of a Player’s Journey, we learn that the Endgame is the most neglected and one of the hardest phases to optimize.</p>\n<p><em>Brag Buttons (Game Technique #57)</em> and <em>Trophy Shelves (Game Technique #64)</em>: Bragging is when a person explicitly and vocally expresses their accomplishments and achievements, whereas a Trophy Shelf allows a person to implicitly show off what they have accomplished without really saying it.</p>\n<p><em>Group Quests (Game Technique #22)</em>: Group Quests are very effective in collaborative play as well as viral marketing because it requires group participation before any individual can achieve the Win-State.</p>\n<p><em>Social Treasures (Game Technique #63)</em>: Social Treasures are gifts or rewards that can only be given to you by friends or other players.</p>\n<p><em>Social Prods (Game Technique #62)</em>: Another game technique that is often seen within Core Drive 5 is the Social Prod. A Social Prod is an action of minimal effort to create a social interaction, often a simple click of a button. Good examples are Facebook Pokes/Likes and Google’s +1s.</p>\n<p><em>Conformity Anchor (Game Technique #58)</em>: Displaying how close users are to the social norm through Feedback Mechanics.</p>\n<p><em>Water Coolers (Game Technique #55)</em> Another way to reinforce Social Influence and Conformity Anchors in your system is by establishing Water Coolers. The water cooler is often the place where people take a small break from work and chat about a variety of non-work related topics. Much of the conversations focus around office gossip or complaints, and actively gets employees to bond with one another. It’s important to first create a strong community that already has a lot to discuss and then introduce the Water Cooler to unleash the social energy. Otherwise, you will end up having an office with a water cooler but no employees in it.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 6 Scarcity and Impatience: it is the drive that motivates us simply because we are either unable to have something immediately, or because there is great difficulty in obtaining it.</p>\n<p>When there is a perceived abundance, motivation starts to dwindle. The odd thing is, our perception is often influenced by relative changes instead of absolute values.</p>\n<p><em>Anchored Juxtaposition (Game Technique #69)</em>: With this technique, you place two options side by side: one that costs money, the other requiring a great amount of effort in accomplishing the Desired Actions which will benefit the system.</p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that rewards can be physical, emotional, or intellectual. Rewards don’t have to be financial nor do they need to come in the form of badges - people hardly pay for those. In fact, based on Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback principles, the most effective rewards are often Boosters that allow the user to go back into the ecosystem and play more effectively, creating a streamlined activity loop in the process.</p>\n<p><em>Magnetic Caps (Game Technique#68)</em>: Magnetic Caps are limitations placed on how many times a user can commit certain Desired Actions, which then stimulates more motivation to commit them.</p>\n<p>The feeling of abundance does not motivate our brains. Scarcity, on the other hand, is incredibly motivating towards our actions. Even if the user committed the ultimate Desired Action by paying a lot of money, a persuasive system designer should only give people a temporary sense of abundance. After a few weeks or months, the feeling of scarcity should crawl back again with new targets for the user to obtain - perhaps after they have used up all of their virtual currencies and needing to purchase their next batch. A great system designer should always control the flow of scarcity, and make sure everyone in the system is still striving for a goal that is difficult, but not impossible, to attain. Failure to do so would cause a gratifying system to implode with users abandoning it for better grounds.</p>\n<p><em>Appointment Dynamics (Game Technique #21)</em>: Another way to reinforce this Core Drive is to harness the scarcity of time. Appointment Dynamics utilize a formerly declared, or recurring schedule where users have to take the Desired Actions to effectively reach the Win-State.</p>\n<p>A <em>Torture Break (Game Technique #66)</em> is a sudden and often triggered pause to the Desired Actions.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 7 Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity is the main force behind our infatuation with experiences that are uncertain and involve chance.</p>\n<p>Studies have shown that we are more engaged in an experience when there is the possibility of winning than when we know our odds for certain4. If we know we will receive a reward, our excitement only reflects the emotional value of the reward itself. However, when we only have a chance to gain the reward our brains are more engaged by the thrill of whether we will win or not.</p>\n<p>Unpredictable results stemming from Core Drive 7 can drive obsessive behavior.</p>\n<p><em>Easter Eggs/Sudden Rewards (Game Technique #30)</em>: Different from Mystery Boxes, Easter Eggs (or Sudden Rewards) are surprises that are given out without the user acknowledging it beforehand. In other words, where Mystery Boxes are unexpected rewards based on a certain expected trigger, Easter Eggs are rewards based on unexpected triggers.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity is a powerful Black Hat Core Drive that is intrinsically thrilling. For any engagement design, it is productive to ask yourself, “Is there any way to add a little bit of randomness and chance to the process?” By using techniques that are designed for curiosity and unpredictability, companies can drive their customers to engage with their product and retain these customers much longer into the Endgame Phase.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 8 Loss and Avoidance motivates through the fear of losing something or having undesirable events transpire.</p>\n<p>Utilizing this Black Hat Core Drive is extraordinarily powerful in getting someone to take the Desired Action, but in the long run, it demoralizes the user’s experience and creates burnout which can lead to high turnover.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to become happy may be to adjust our expectations and appreciate what we do have, instead of becoming upset because of the things we don’t.</p>\n<p><em>Rightful Heritage (Game Technique #46)</em>: A system first makes a user believe something rightfully belongs to them (remember expectations matter a lot?), and then makes them feel like it will be taken away if they don’t commit the Desired Action.</p>\n<p><em>Evanescent Opportunities (Game Technique #86)</em>: An Evanescent Opportunity is an opportunity that will disappear if the user does not take the Desired Action immediately.</p>\n<p><em>Countdown Timers (Game Technique #65)</em>: A Countdown Timer is a visual display that communicates the passage of time towards a tangible event. Sometimes the Countdown Timer is to introduce the start of a great opportunity, while at other times it’s to signify the end of the opportunity.</p>\n<p><em>The Sunk Cost Prison (Game Technique #50)</em>: This occurs when you invest so much time into something, that even when it’s no longer enjoyable, you continue to commit the Desired Actions because you don’t want to feel the loss of giving up on everything.</p>\n<p>The Left Brain Core Drives involve tendencies related to logic, ownership, and analytical thought.</p>\n<p>The Right Brain Core Drives are characterized by creativity, sociality, and curiosity</p>\n<p>Extrinsic Motivation is motivation that is derived from a goal, purpose, or reward. The task itself is not necessarily interesting or appealing, but because of the goal or reward, people become driven and motivated to complete the task. More often than not, people go to work everyday not because they actually love doing the work, but because they want to make a living, advance their careers, and be recognized for higher achievements.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic Motivation, on the other hand, is simply the motivation you get by inherently enjoying the task itself.</p>\n<p>Left Brain Core Drives are by nature goal-oriented, while Right Brain Core Drives are experience-oriented. Extrinsic Motivation focuses on results, while Intrinsic Motivation focuses on the process.</p>\n<p>Motivation is what drives us to do any action, and Rewards are what we obtain once we perform the Desired Action.</p>\n<p>Here is the test I usually apply to determine if something is extrinsically or intrinsically motivated: if the goal or objective were removed, would the person still be motivated to take the Desired Action or not?</p>\n<p>“Overjustification Effect” - I become primarily engaged with the reward which subsequently eradicates and replaces the intrinsic motivation I originally had in the first place.</p>\n<p>When a person is trying to solve the problem for free, the activity resembles play. The mind searches for new, creative ways to do things. This makes the right solution easier to find because the mind is flexible and dynamic. In contrast, when a person is offered a reward, the situation immediately becomes one devoid of play. Unless clear, simple directions are laid out for the person, performance will actually decrease because the mind is fixated on completing the assignment.</p>\n<p>It is better to attract people into an experience using Extrinsic Rewards (gift cards, money, merchandise, discounts), then transition their interest through Intrinsic Rewards (recognition, status, access), and finally use Intrinsic Motivation to ensure their long term engagement.</p>\n<p>When you design for Intrinsic Motivation, you want to create environments that foster socializing, even with areas that are non-critical to the Desired Actions</p>\n<p>Obtaining a reward is in and of itself extrinsic. However, when you make the reward variable, you add a layer of intrinsic excitement, much like how the animal in the Skinner Box continues to press the lever to get more food, even though it is no longer hungry.</p>\n<p>White Hat Core Drives are motivation elements that make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. They make us feel in control of our own lives and actions. In contrast, Black Hat Core Drives, make us feel obsessed, anxious, and addicted. While they are very strong in motivating our behaviors, in the long run they often leave a bad taste in our mouths because we feel we’ve lost control of our own behaviors.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, Core Drive 4 and Core Drive 5 have the duality of being able to be either White Hat or Black Hat.</p>\n<p>Owning things make us feel like we are in control, that things are organized, and our general well-being is improving. We feel powerful and enriched.</p>\n",

It goes through the origins of Scrum and the concepts behind it. It is filled with success stories, projects that were not going that well (now that's an understatement), like the Sentinel project of the FBI, and how applying Scrum to them improved their outcome.</p>\n<p>And this is exactly the reason I gave it 3 stars (which in Goodreads score means &quot;I liked it&quot;) and not 4. One of the most important things that Jeff Sutherlands has to share is his experience across the years of hundreds (or who knows how many?) of Scrum implementations. While he does make recommendations all-over the place, all his examples are nice and dandy, easy-peasy! I would've expected him to talk more about the pitfalls and common mistakes teams and companies do when implementing Scrum. This being said, the book is a nice read for a beginner in Scrum, but I don't find it enough to get started with Scrum. I would suggest pairing it up with Henrik Kniberg's book, <a href=\"https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/scrum-and-xp-from-the-trenches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scrum and XP from the Trenches</a> which is very hands-on and to the point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notes</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#notes\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Notes”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>The term [Scrum] comes from the game of rugby and it refers to the way a team works together to move the ball down the field. Careful alignment, unity of purpose, and clarity of goal come together</p>\n<p>At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in, see if what you're doing is heading in the right direction, and if it's actually what people want? And question where there any ways to improve how you're doing what you're doing, any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from doing that. =&gt; &quot;Inspect and Adapt&quot; cycle.</p>\n<p>Production should flow swiftly and calmly throughout the process and one of management's key tasks is to identify and remove impediments to that flow. Everything that stands in the way is waste.</p>\n<p>The effect of eliminating waste is dramatic, but people often don't do it, because it requires being honest with themselves and with others.</p>\n<p>Scrum works by setting sequential goals that must be completed in a fixed length of time.</p>\n<p>The Japanese professors Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka compared the teams' work to that of a rugby team and said the best teams acted as though they were in a scrum: &quot;... the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field.&quot;</p>\n<p>The method to take action, and perhaps what Deming is most famous for, is the PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act).</p>\n<p>Hesitation is death. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. Know where you are, assess your options, make a decision, and act!</p>\n<p>Professors Takeuchi and Nonaka described the characteristics of the teams they saw at the best companies in the world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transcendent: They have the sense of purpose beyond the ordinary</li>\n<li>Autonomous: The teams are self-organizing and self-managing</li>\n<li>Cross-Functional: The teams have all the skills needed to complete the project</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scrum teams should come out of the daily meeting knowing the most important thing they need to accomplish that day.</p>\n<p>Each Sprint is an opportunity to do something totally new; each day, a change to improve.</p>\n<p>Time is finite. Treat it that way. Break down your work into what can be accomplished in a regular, set, short period - optimally one to four weeks.</p>\n<p>The heart of Scrum is rhythm. Rhythm is deeply important to human beings.</p>\n<p>&quot;Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss.&quot; Taiichi Ohno</p>\n<p>Ohno talked about three types of waste:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Muri: waste through unreasonableness</li>\n<li>Mura: waste through inconsistency</li>\n<li>Muda: waste through outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plan means avoid Muri. Do means avoid Mura. Check means avoid Muda. Act means the will, motivation, and determination to do all that.</p>\n<p>&quot;People don't multitask because they're good at it. They do it because they are more distracted. They have trouble inhibiting the impulse to do another activity.&quot; David Sanbonmatsu</p>\n<p>People are good at relative sizing, comparing one size to another.</p>\n<p>When you're writing your stories you want to make sure that they're small enough that you can actually estimate them.</p>\n<p>People aren't happy because they're successful; they're successful because they're happy.</p>\n<p>It is crucial that people as a team take responsibility for their process and outcomes, and seek solutions as a team. At the same time, people have to have the fortitude to bring up the issues that are really bothering them in a way that is solution oriented rather than accusatory. And the rest of the team has to have the maturity to hear the feedback, take it in, and look for a solution rather than get defensive.</p>\n<p>The Happiness Metric: at the end of each Sprint, each person on the team answers just a few questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company?</li>\n<li>On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole?</li>\n<li>Why do you feel that way?</li>\n<li>What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What are the things that actually make people happy? They're the same things that make great teams: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>\n<p>One element of Scrum that's often a prelude to achieving autonomy, mastery and purpose is transparency.</p>\n<p>annualized attrition rate: An annualized attrition rate is the ratio of the total number of employees who exit from an organization due to death, retirements, resignations or any other reasons to the average number of employees who remain on the payroll for the whole year. The Human Resources department typically calculates this rate.</p>\n<p>Leadership has nothing to do with authority. Rather, it has to do with - among other things - knowledge and being a servant-leader.</p>\n<p>Essential characteristics of a Product Owner:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>needs to be knowledgeable about the domain</li>\n<li>has to be empowered to make decisions</li>\n<li>has to be available to the team</li>\n<li>needs to be accountable for value</li>\n</ol>\n",

So an agile coach doesn't just take care of the process, but coaches and mentors the team and the people in it, to be better at agile, by also taking a look at the human side of things.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed reading this book, although it is quite dense in ideas which generally doesn't make a book very accessible. The book can either be read through and through or be used as a reference. It describes the different sides of an agile coach and then there are dedicated chapters for each. It is definitely a book that needs revisiting and at least two passes to be able to grasp most of the details. And, of course, you need to practice and experiment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Notes</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#notes\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Notes”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Becoming an agile coach entails education, experience, and practice.</p>\n<p>The paths toward being an agile coach are as many and varied as the places from which individuals start their journey.</p>\n<p>The qualities common to most successful agile coaches reflect openness, people orientation, and a deep and passionate pursuit of personal and professional excellence.</p>\n<p>Set the bar high and set the expectation that the team will achieve it. Create a sense of anticipation, expectancy, and excitement for this journey-first in yourself and then let it flow to them. Lead by believing.</p>\n<p>The High Performance Tree is a metaphor for high performance. At the bottom we put the Scrum values, or XP values or whatever values are relevant for the team. Continuing drawing the tree, the team notices they have sprouted some things themselves, maybe the characteristics of high collaboration = the leaves. If the roots are strong and the leaves gather in enough light, the tree will bear fruit. These are the fruits of high performance.</p>\n<p>Use the tree to analyse which of the root values the team neglects when things don't go as intended. It also represents a vision of what the team can be or become, the fruits that it can collect if the roots are nurtured and the leafs get enough light.</p>\n<p>Make the high performance goal visual, either through the tree metaphor or any other that suits you best ( a house, a garden etc).</p>\n<p><code>Over-seriousness is a warning sign for mediocrity  bureaucratic thinking. People who are seriously committed to a mastery and high performance are secure enough to lighten up.</code> Michael J. Gelb</p>\n<p>Assess your native conflict mode response. One popular diagnostic is the Thomas Kilmann Instrument (TKI), which is a categorisation of common conflict response modes : Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Accommodating, and Avoiding.</p>\n<p>You muse pay attention to your language and take responsibility for your emotional wake. This means that you own up to your impact whether harm was intended and whether you think the other person should el hurt or not.</p>\n<p><code>For a leader there is no such thing as a trivial comment. Something you might not even remember saying may have had a devastating impact on someone looking to you for guidance and approval</code> Susan Scott</p>\n<p><code>Make sure that other people highest priority needs are being served</code> Robert Greenleaf</p>\n<p><code>It is often a devastating question to ask oneself, but it is sometimes important to ask it.'In saying what I have in mind will I really improve on the silence?'</code> Robert Greenleaf</p>\n<p>With conflict, language, servant leadership, and emotional intelligence, feel your knee-jerk reaction, notice it, and consciously decide what to do with it. Your ability to apply this pattern is a direct measure of your ability to master yourself.</p>\n<p>Avoid Command-and-Control-ism</p>\n<pre><code>  * Be detached from outcomes\n  * Take it to the team\n  * Be a mirror\n  * Master your words and your face\n  * Let there be silence\n  * Model being outrageous\n  * Let the team fail\n  * Always be their biggest fan, but be careful\n</code></pre>\n<p>To be of service to the team, flee yourself from your worries and racing thoughts. Your mind must be still so that you can see, with clarity, what happens with the team. You are likely to witness the best d the worst in people, sometimes just minutes apart. To stand in these storm winds without being blown over, find your center. To do this, master your self through a daily practice.</p>\n<p>How can I best be of service to the group? Stay connected to one thing you care about.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you should not influence in any way what happens in the team, simply reflect it. More often the reaction is about you and that has no place in coaching. Notice your reaction and carefully choose ether to act on it.</p>\n<p>How are you listening?</p>\n<pre><code>  * Level 1 - internal listening: you receive whatever is said and meet it with your own concern about\n  * Level 2 - focused listening: a hardwire connection gets established between the coach and speaker. Freed from the personal lens, the coach listens and responds in the moment with questions and silences that help the speaker move through whatever they are expressing\n  * Level 3 - global listening: the coach uses everything in the environment when listening\n</code></pre>\n<p>Choose when and if to speak: don't speak first or don't speak at all.</p>\n<p>Use 3 coaching style: Teaching, Coaching and Advising, as the team evolves between Shu, Ha and Ri stages of mastery. This whole time, pay attention to Modeling and Reaching.</p>\n<p>Constantly model the behaviours that lead to success: listening to one another, building on each other's ideas, courageously facing impediments, and tending toward the simplest thing possible.</p>\n<p>Reach out to each team member and the team as a whole to help them achieve the best expression of agile possible.</p>\n<p>In the context of agile teams, coaching takes the dual flavour of coaching and mentoring.</p>\n<p>When coaching and agile team, you simultaneously coach them at two levels: the individual level and the whole-team level.</p>\n<p>The groundwork when coaching one-on-one:</p>\n<pre><code>  * Meet them a half-step ahead\n  * Guarantee safety\n  * Partner with managers\n  * Create a positive regard\n</code></pre>\n<p>When coaching the product owner, cultivate business-value driven thinking in all interactions</p>\n<p>When coaching agile managers, there are three fundamental areas to adopt agile mind-sets and behaviours</p>\n<pre><code>  * managing teams\n  * managing investments - what is the best investment right now?\n  * managing the environment\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sponsors are a special kind of manager and require coaching so that they learn how to get more than they imagined they could from self-organised teams.</p>\n<p>Achievements by doing the stand-up well:</p>\n<pre><code>  * peer pressure\n  * fine-grain coordination\n  * focusing on the few\n  * daily commitment\n  * raising impediments\n</code></pre>\n<p>The purpose of spring planning: know the work, get a fresh start, commit to shared goals, create focus and abundance.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the sprint review: true-up (call out what was and was not accomplished and ask for acceptance), show and tell, get direct feedback, offer insights, ask for help.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the retrospective: inspect and adapt, look back at how (not what), do (even) better next time.</p>\n<p>Three main tools you can use to help the team have quality conversations: powerful observations, powerful questions and powerful challenges.</p>\n<p>Intervene with the team more in the beginning, when you are teaching them agile, and step back as soon as you can to support their continuous self-organisation.</p>\n<p>Address the following areas during team start-up:</p>\n<pre><code>  * Learn about the process to be used\n  * Learn about the team\n  * Learn about the work ahead\n  * Go!\n</code></pre>\n<p>An effective product owner is Committed, Responsible, Authorised, Collaborative and Knowledgeable.</p>\n<p>An agile manager is: organisational change artist, boundary keeper, value maximiser, lean manager, organisational impediment remover, team champion.</p>\n<p>An agile coach is: bulldozer, shepherd, servant leader and guardian of quality and performance.</p>\n<p>Teach everyone about agile roles, and ask them to expect that the people around them will completely fulfil their role. Anything less is an impediment.</p>\n<p>Constantly seek role clarity for yourself, and train other to do the same.</p>\n<p>When teams go wrong, the source of trouble can often be linked directly to one or more of the following dimensions: boundary, authority, role and task (BART).</p>\n<p>An agile coach should resolve problems by taking them to the team and: address directly, reaffirm agile, reveal the system to itself, use the retrospective or add a revealer.</p>\n<p>The only job of the agile coach is to reveal the system to itself through observation that invites exploration - you simply state what you observe and then allow silence.</p>\n<p>Once you detect problems, design a retrospective that will likely raise them.</p>\n<p>One of the hallmarks of highly collaborative teams is that they use conflict constructively. They live in a world of constructive disagreement.</p>\n<p>As their coach, you help teams navigate conflict.</p>\n<p>Five levels of conflict by Speed Leas:</p>\n<pre><code>  * Level 1 - problem to solve: team remains focused on determining what's awry and how to fix it\n  * Level 2 - disagreement: self-protection becomes as important as solving the problem\n  * Level 3 - contest: the aim is to win\n  * Level 4 - crusade: resolving the situation is not good enough\n  * Level 5 - world war: it's not enough that one wins, others must lose.\n</code></pre>\n<p>While observing, pay attention to these three things that help assess the level of conflict: hear complaints, feel the energy, and focus on language.</p>\n<p>An agile coach helps the team see that conflict is normal - and useful - if it remains constructive.</p>\n<p>Whenever possible, get the complainer to address the grievance directly, either alone or with you in tow. Avoid triangulation, when one party talks about another party to someone else, at all costs.</p>\n<p>As the coach, know that someone who wants to gossip doesn't want to resolve the complaint. Hear them fully, give them your observation that they don't seem ready to resolve the complaint, and let them know that you will take no action.</p>\n<p>To boot the positivity/negativity ration on teams, help them avoid misunderstanding buildup and use a shared vision.</p>\n<p>Make sure that everyone gets heard.</p>\n<p>Difference between collaboration and cooperation? Collaboration yields that old adage: The whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Cooperation yields the sum of the parts.</p>\n<p>Collaboration needs cooperation as its base, but it adds the essential ingredient for yielding innovative, breakthrough, astonishing results: emergence.</p>\n<p>Offer four things to help them become solid cooperators and collaborators: teach them cooperation skills, expect them to come prepared, encourage their ego, and establish the collaboration zone.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve cooperation the team members must know what each other person brings to the team: their skills, talents, desires, and work preferences. They must know one another as human beings first and workmates second. This creates the base from which they self-organise to get the work done.</p>\n<p>Team members must cooperate with one another because they share the short list of goals they committed to deliver together.</p>\n<p>One of the first collaboration skills to build makes it acceptable for team members to speak out about things that make them feel vulnerable or uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Create safety for the team to stay vulnerable to one another and keep speaking the unspeakable. Achieve this by demonstrating tolerance for failure, refraining from punitive exercises of power, and participating in team processes rather than imposing rules.</p>\n<p>Two types of behaviour kill synergy: people saying more than they know, and people saying less than they know.</p>\n<p>To be of greatest service to teams, an agile coach must become free from personal agendas. Collaboration works when one gives away one's own ideas to the group and allows that idea to be just a piece of bigger idea yet to emerge.</p>\n<p>Judgment, intellect, planning, perception, and reality-awareness swirl around in an intricate dance in the ego, allowing you to be confident enough to risk speaking your ideas.</p>\n<p>Replace fear with trust by cultivating mindfulness, be curious, get a broader view, pair and practice success.</p>\n",

There's the occasional walker and the soothing sound of the fountain, but not much else. Everything else is synchronised with its arrival. The majestic metal runner that brings people to their destination.</p>\n<p>You wouldn't expect anything grandiose to happen, judging by how everything looks like. Some beggars at the entrance of the supermarket, one or two shoppers jumping from one deal to another, a couple of bored taxis standing by in the station and a homeless drinking his life from cheap beer cans. Far from majestic and yet, you're up for a treat!</p>\n<p>You can feel something is about to happen. More people start coming one by one and going up the stairs. A bus carrying some lonely riders going home from this neck of the city arrives slowly in the station. They hurry up the stairs as well, you can feel their tension.

It's his break, he finished the tour early so he can have a well deserved smoke.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the_turmoil\" tabindex=\"-1\">The turmoil</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_turmoil\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The turmoil”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In the meantime, a hissing sound becomes louder and louder and louder.

This is the refrain of countless project managers on their LinkedIn profiles: it is the badge of the successful project manager, and they wear it with pride.\n\nIt is also a misguided and dangerous idea that invariably encourages a short-sighted and bureaucratic mind-set, detrimental to both project teams and the organisations they serve. \n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Totally agree with the above, it's an aged mindset and it should be adjusted.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;Ask not: what will this feature cost to build, ask: what will this feature do for my organisation\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is a tendency to think about the cost first and about the value of a feature second. You hear a lot of questions like, &quot;How long will this feature take?&quot; when the prioritization decisions should be made on the value first and the time (cost) it takes second.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;There is no such thing as &quot;scope creep&quot;. There are only folk trying to articulate their growing understanding of the actual business needs. \n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I agree that scope is something that evolves, because most of the time the deadlines are fixed for a reason. And the only think you can do is to adjust the scope and focus on delivering the minimal value that will make the project accomplish its goals until the deadline.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, there's also scope creep. Features that are not really needed to accomplish the goals, they are just nice to haves that would make the result better, but are not <em>necessary</em> for its success.</p>\n",

Emails, Facebook notifications, playlist notifications, colleague asking for help, loud neighbours, annoying ad and so many others, they are all running your power of concentration really low.</p>\n<p>There are all kind of discussions about how knowledge workers have a hard time nowadays to produce '<a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deep work</a>', the kind of work and thinking that is required when trying to solve difficult and profound problems.</p>\n<p>All these distractions have become part of the normal, we rarely know how to work without being distracted. When we are not being interrupted, we find distractions ourselves, because that's how we got used to.</p>\n<p>You know all this and if you don't, I suggest you follow <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cal Newport</a>, he researches and writes extensively about it.</p>\n<p>But this is not what I wanted to talk about today. Well, still about distractions, but specifically when these are used for procrastinating important work. Truth is that doing important work is not always pleasant, especially when starting up.</p>\n<p>And I say this from experience. Many times I find myself buying all kind of new cool apps or tools or whatever, telling myself they would help me get done things easier. Then I need to learn how to use these and I tell myself that once I get used to them, I'll be the most productive person in the world.</p>\n<p>All this, just to jump from one distraction or pretext to another, so I don't start working on that important thing, which will get me further on my path and make me a better <em>you_name_what</em>. And that is because important work is hard and most of the time you don't know exactly what you are doing. It involves discovering and trying out new things and many, many, many times, it involves <em>failing</em>.</p>\n<p>So what I am saying here (thanks for reading so far, you're a <strong>star</strong>!) is make your decisions based on how they serve your goals. And if you decide to cut yourself some slack and buy that cool shiny new app, go ahead! But at least don't lie to yourself that it will be the next best thing after sliced bread, because most of the times it won't be.</p>\n",

Here are a few characteristics of the projects I think story maps fit best:</p>\n<pre><code>  * projects with rather limited time and budget\n  * projects where the client wants to see results fast\n  * projects where the scope is not that well defined or it is quite large\n  * projects whose scope changes often\n  * projects with a medium to large development team\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you work on a project that has 2 or 3 of these characteristics, then I recommend you to use story mapping to plan you project and create awareness of what you're planning to build.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#why\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Why?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Story mapping helps you to</p>\n<pre><code>  * focus on what is the most important thing to deliver\n  * deliver often and deliver software that works\n  * easily make stakeholders aware of what you will deliver and when (high level)\n  * change priorities and scope easier\n  * visualise the (moving) parts of what you are trying to build\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"how\" tabindex=\"-1\">How?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “How?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>While I won't get into details, I would like to point out some of the core concepts that make all the money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you_start_with_the_backbone\" tabindex=\"-1\">You start with the backbone</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#you_start_with_the_backbone\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “You start with the backbone”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Before anything, you split your project in its main components. These are the top stories of your story map, also called the backbone. I like the car analogy that Jeff Patton mentions, the backbone would be formed out of the engine, the transmission, the brakes, the suspension and so on.</p>\n<p>Some people would call these epics, because they are very large stories that you cannot really start working on. But I wouldn't see them as the classical meaning of epics that form your backlog, for the simple reason that most of these backbone stories will be completed when the project is over. If you really need epics in your backlog (if you need a backlog), I would model them around another concept of story mapping, details later on...</p>\n<h3 id=\"you_continue_with_the_activities\" tabindex=\"-1\">You continue with the activities</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#you_continue_with_the_activities\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “You continue with the activities”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Next step is to split all these backbone stories into smaller stories, ones that are easier to grasp and you could maybe take them in a sprint (if you do sprints). Put the most important ones at the top and spread the rest towards the bottom or the least important ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"then_you_define_iterations_and_start_working\" tabindex=\"-1\">Then you define iterations and start working</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#then_you_define_iterations_and_start_working\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Then you define iterations and start working”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One of the most important concepts of story mapping is delivering working software in iterations. You start with building a minimum viable product (MVP) or a <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">walking skeleton</a>, a version of the project that works, end-to-end (if possible), in a very basic way. And afterwards you add more features or improve existing ones in the later iterations until it's good enough.</p>\n<p>I see the first iteration the most important one and maybe the most difficult to slice. And that is because you have to make the stakeholders decide on what are the most important things or characteristics to deliver first. And you have to be ruthless about it!</p>\n<p>Making this or these first iterations too big and you will delay the moment where you get precious feedback. Also, you will learn a lot in these first iterations, that could change the way the next iterations will play along. Therefore, try to keep them small and focused.</p>\n<p>One thing that brings value, is to set a short description for each iteration. What is each iteration about? What is the team trying to accomplish with it? This should keep the team focused and avoid scope creep. If you really need to add something else in those iterations, mark them as stretch stories as you probably can accomplish the goal of that iteration without completing them.</p>\n<p>If you need epics, then I would suggest to consider the iterations as epics. This way they don't live too long and when they are done, you have something working.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final_notes_and_remarks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Final notes and remarks</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#final_notes_and_remarks\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Final notes and remarks”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><pre><code>  1. As I see it, story mapping is about focusing on the important things and always being able to visualise the full scope at a certain point in time. Yes, the content of the later iterations will change, you can count on that!\n  2. The most important aspect of the iteration is _what_ it tries to accomplish and **not** _how much time_ it takes. Finish an iteration when the scope is done and not when the &quot;estimated&quot; allocated time passed. Sure, when an iteration takes longer, you should ask yourself why, but don't beat yourself up too much, especially when attacking the first iterations.\n  3. Story mapping goes well with [#NoEstimates](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoEstimates&amp;src=tyah), so you could try to slice the stories in equal sizes and count them or introduce story sizes. The size wouldn't be used for fitting the stories in an interation, but just to be able to do better projections. So yes, you would be estimating in the team if a story is small, medium or large, but don't spend more than a minute on each, it won't bring value.\n  4. In order to do projections, you need some sort of data to build those projections on. Don't expect to be very good at predicting how fast you will deliver things when you are starting a new team. You need some time to get things into motion, to get better at story mapping, sliceing and doing all these things together in the team.\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"useful_reading\" tabindex=\"-1\">Useful reading</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#useful_reading\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Useful reading”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>If you are interested in learning more about story mapping but not only, check out the following:</p>\n<pre><code>  * Jeff Patton's [book](http://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/)\n  * Vasco Duarte's #NoEstimates [book and resources](http://noestimatesbook.com/)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am still quite young in the world of story mapping and every time I start a new story map I try to improve some things. What you read above is based on what I read from different sources and also what I experienced myself.

A sense of purpose is about going faster and smarter toward a mission we all see clearly. It’s about using good judgment because we all understand the short and long term implications of our actions on what we’re creating together.\n<p>A strong sense of purpose manifests when a software engineer watches a potential customer struggle with a workflow and stays late to make the changes that make it easier. It shows itself when a designer spends their weekend on a few extra iterations because they felt engaged with the problem at hand and want to produce a better solution.</p>\n<p>Turns out when you stop looking to create urgency, the passion and purpose latent in your team might just cause the right things to get done at just the right pace.</blockquote></p>\n<p>It could seem more difficult to foster a sense of purpose and maybe less &quot;efficient&quot; in the beginning, but it pays off later on, when instead of micro-managing, you get time to take care of much more important things.</p>\n",

I know, I know, after a disappointing keynote, I continued on the IoT track, but I actually enjoyed Mark's presentation. More of a freeform presentation, he talked about his home project where he built his own renewable energy source with a bunch of solar panels and a small wind mill. His goal was to gather and store enough green energy to power his tool shed from the garden of his house.</p>\n<p>Besides that, he wanted to be able to check remotely his setup and be able to automatically keep the temperature in the shed pretty much constant. Living in St. Louis, Missouri, the temperatures get pretty low in the winter and pretty high in the summer. So through some automatization, his setup would start a fan and open the windows in the summer or start a small heater lamp in the winter. All this done with mostly off-the-shelf components with quite a small budget. He used an <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arduino</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raspberry Pi</a> to orchestrate everything. Also, sometimes you can use components which aren't designed for IoT, but can still do the job at much more convenient prices (e.g. an actuator, used also in cars).</p>\n<h2 id=\"how_spotify_models_microservices\" tabindex=\"-1\">How Spotify models microservices</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how_spotify_models_microservices\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “How Spotify models microservices”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Back to the microservices theme, Spotify has quite the network of microservices. This presentation was about their internal software called System-Z, which is &quot;a system for system metadata&quot;. It is basically a platform that allows them to manage all their services. It offers general component (component = service) information, dependency tracking, management of deployments, alerting and many other features. I would say it's a pretty crucial system for an architecture with several hundreds of services running at the same time, including maybe many versions of the same service, each with its dependencies and configuration specifics.</p>\n<p>Now this was about the time I saw the first people falling asleep in the audience. Maybe these were some of the participants to the Vaadin Jfokus cruise, but at the same time I can't really blame them. The presentation was rather poorly done, from the presenter who was mentioning pretty much all the time &quot;I don't think you can see this&quot; or asking colleagues from the audience to confirm things, to rather loaded slides and difficult to read. Not good, Spotify, I had bigger expectations from you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"at_war_with_requirements\" tabindex=\"-1\">At war with requirements</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#at_war_with_requirements\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “At war with requirements”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>A few &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexchiri/status/697037960311603201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boohoos</a>&quot; later, I joined the <em>How to defeat feature gluttony?</em> by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MrowcaKasia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kasia Mrowca</a>. An interesting topic and an interesting presentation. Who doesn't want to get rid of scope creep, detailed estimates and all the bad feeling and frustration that comes out of these? There were some cool ideas, like the &quot;tree of features&quot;, adding risk and business value to estimates and the Love/ROI scale.</p>\n<p>On the downside, we started quite late because the laptop connector was faulty (there were issues in the morning, in the same room) and some of the text in the presentation was screwed up. Also, Kasia kept mentioning the font mess during the presentation and she wasn't speaking English that well (I know, this coming from the person who had to google &quot;gluttony&quot; before the talk).

Being a very beginner in this topic, I decided to focus mostly on it through the <a href=\"http://jfokus.se\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jfokus</a> conference this year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crichardson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris Richardson</a>'s tutorial, <em>Introduction to microservices</em> was comprehensive, taking us through the basic concepts, patterns and strategies behind them. Without going too much into details, there was lots of useful content and the presentation consists a good base to understand what are microservices about and give you several points to continue to find out more on your own. I suggest you follow Chris and especially go check out <a href=\"http://microservices.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microservices.io</a> for even more material on the topic.</p>\n<p>If you're curious about some of the ideas he shared during the presentation, check out <a href=\"https://mm.tt/647630949?t=HSTn9Fvvas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the mindmap I did</a> during the talk. It's quite large, I suggest you expand branches while you go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no_were_not_gaming_we_are_mob_programming\" tabindex=\"-1\">No we're not gaming, we are Mob programming!</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#no_were_not_gaming_we_are_mob_programming\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “No we're not gaming, we are Mob programming!”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Although I said I want to focus on microservices, the Mob programming workshop was one of reasons I decided to go to the conference. I have been interested for a while in &quot;alternative&quot; development processes and I have been following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woody Zuill</a> online for some time. Not just for <code>#MobProgramming</code> but also for <code>#NoEstimates</code>.</p>\n<p>And the workshop was a really good experience. We did several exercises to feel some of the pains I'm sure everyone experienced in &quot;agile&quot; development. Notice the quotes. Yes, I am talking about estimates, requirements and all that mess. Mob programming brings the focus on the basic values of Agile, big highlight on people and interactions and working software. We briefly demonstrated how it works through some more exercises, but also through 2 short sessions of Mob programming while trying to solve the <a href=\"http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roman Numerals Kata</a>.</p>\n<p>I recommend following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woody</a> and his work and understanding the concepts behind it. There's plenty to learn!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>When I started working almost daily with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReactJS</a> a few months ago, I was pretty challenged (still am) with all the different modules to use and the concepts that I wasn't used with in the Java world. So I thought of a fun side-project with ReactJS to learn more and try some of the &quot;crazy&quot; things I couldn't really use at work at that point. Because I wanted to be able to do some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">link-blogging</a> as well and <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghost</a> (or any of the themes I liked) didn't facilitate it I decided to go wild and build my own blog in ReactJS. A blog that would slowly include all the things I would want!!! Exciting, isn't it?</p>\n<p>The first obstacle I had was what to begin with? There are sooo many (really, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=react%20starter%20kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so many</a>) starter kits out there for ReactJS that it was pretty overwhelming for a complete n00b. I followed <a href=\"http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">terop's tutorial</a> (and what a good tutorial!) and that gave me an idea of the basic bricks of ReactJS world. I kinda liked the idea of <a href=\"http://isomorphic.net/javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">isomorphic</a> or <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">universal</a> apps so I started looking around on my favourite source of inspiration: <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>After some time, I found <a href=\"https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rick's starter kit</a> and decided it's something I would like to use as a base. Not for my blog project, but for my-own-yet-another-react-starter-kit, which I called <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/isomorphic-from-scratch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">isomorphic-from-scratch</a>. I called it like this because while I started from Rick's repo, I really wanted to understand how things are working in it and adjust it to my like it. Which I did!</p>\n<p>1-2 weeks later, I was satisfied with what I had and use my kit to start the blog project, <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/minimalistic-blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimalistic-blog</a>. And my focus was on getting it working in a very basic shape. I'm not a CSS guy, so I kept things very, very, very minimalistic, as long as they were working.</p>\n<p>Some more time later, I got to a stage I like, which does the minimal things I want to have in order to put it live. Which simply meant to be able to list create, edit posts and link-blogging.</p>\n<p>And that's pretty much where I am now. In the next period, I will take some time to add documentation and write a few posts about my findings, add tests (yeah, I didn't write one single test), update the admin interface to look decent and keep up with the latest versions of everything.</p>\n<p>One of the things I am proud of, as a JS n00b that I am, is the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/isomorphic-from-scratch#authentication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authentication</a> approach I took for the blog. While there's plenty to improve, I like the simplicity of it. Is it super super super secure? Probably not. But I think it is more secure than the average starter kits out there which include authentication.</p>\n<p>If you took the time to read until here, do reach out! I'm interested to hear what you think about this. As you probably noticed, there's no menu, or contact links or anything. He he, who needs 'em? 😁 You can give me a ping on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexchiri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>, I'm looking forward to your feedback! 👍😊</p>\n",

You do all these things every day, until one day, they all stop. You wake yourself in a totally different place where you have to start from scratch.</p>\n<p>I know it's all part of the experience of moving in a different place, but that doesn't stop me from being amazed of the effect an experience like this has on you and how much of the every day bullshit we ignore because of our habits.</p>\n",

Once you're back to work, you need to readjust to the chaos, the routine and all that &quot;work&quot; entails.</p>\n<p>Why does it have to be like this? Why can't you work and do holiday activities on a continuous basis, therefore removing the need for holidays?</p>\n<p>It sounds crazy, it's something our society prevents since you're only a child, but what if?</p>\n<p>One of the things that the artificial intelligence future might bring is that we wouldn't have to work eight hours a day anymore. All the mundane tasks from our life could be done by robots, food production, cleaning, maintenance etc.</p>\n<p>Maybe someday the technical discoveries will make things sustainable and all the basic services would be free. We would not need a job to survive, to get food, a place to live and so on.</p>\n<p>Now don't me wrong, I am not suggesting that we shouldn't work or have a job, I'm merely discussing the reasons of having a job. There are plenty of people stuck on a shitty job, just because they need the income to care for their family or buy medicine or whatever. And there are plenty of people who go every day at work thinking of their holiday. That oasis of life where they get to do all the things that seem forbidden during work days.</p>\n<p>More time to innovate, more time to improve, to research, to be with our loved ones.

Different groups of friends told me that's the norm, after 4 years in the country of tulips, you either stay quite longer or you leave.</p>\n<p>It wasn't a decision of the moment. There were several pro/cons discussions along several months, some research to add to one of the categories or the other and just the will to make yet another leap.

      "content_html": "<p>After sharing <em>The Four Horsemen</em> video (predictions about Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) on LinkedIn, I was asked by one of my connections if I would be willing to join him in preparing a blog that wants to predict the future of social media. Although I think it's a great idea (him who holds the power of information is always ahead), I declined, simply because I'm no social media expert and more important, not an analyst. I consider that a task like that depends on plenty of research and educated guesses and I am missing the research and the educated parts.</p>\n<p>But that doesn't stop me to express a subjective, sort of uninformed, simply based on gut opinion. And that's what this is, the future of MY social media!</p>\n<h2 id=\"facebook\" tabindex=\"-1\">Facebook</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#facebook\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Facebook”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>So here we are, Facebook has 1.4 billion monthly active users and Google plus is somewhere at 300 million, same as Instagram and Twitter.</p>\n<p>I don't think there is any doubt that Facebook is the king of the social jungle, as it has the biggest amount of users who keep coming back every single day. If initially Facebook was only about connecting its users (bait) in a very easy way, its goal was (of course) to use its users as a steady revenue source. In order to do that, they had to diversify, see games, ads, news, search, events, locations, chat, basically whatever it takes for Facebook to become the new Google. If you could find all the information you need inside it, then there's no reason for you to leave and they can make more money from your activity and your personal information. And precisely the large amount of users allowed Facebook to increase ads prices when everyone else is lowering them.</p>\n<p>Doesn't that warm your heart and make you go and share even more of your stuff? And this gets me to talk about the content on Facebook. Most of the content I see from my friends on Facebook is useless pointless utter crap (sorry guys, you know I love you, but...). And I mentioned that it's the content I see, because Facebook <em>filters</em> the content it gives you in your timeline based on your behaviour, so maybe that's the reason for what I see on my timeline.</p>\n<p>Will Facebook still be part of the future of social media? Unless something else more innovative and as catchy will appear, then Facebook will be around for a long time. And even if Facebook decreases in users, their other services like WhatsApp and Instagram are only warming up. Users are lazy, they don't want to change services, especially to move to a network with an empty timeline (check Google+).</p>\n<p>For me Facebook is merely a Yellow Pages of my current and past connections, I rarely post anything or interact with my network. Simply because I find it a waste of time and lack of value, clearly Facebook won't play a very important role in the future of my social media.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ok_then_what\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ok, then what?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#ok_then_what\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Ok, then what?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>While they don't have the numbers of Facebook, smaller specialised networks make more sense to me. I became more active on Twitter because I was able to easily interact with people that share my interests. You could do the same on Facebook (you can follow people on Facebook without being their friends), but then you would have to filter the trash from the value and you would still be facing Facebook's censorship.</p>\n<p>Even though the internal mechanisms are maybe pretty much the same, specialised networks reveal different sides of its members. How many kitty pictures did you see in your LinkedIn timeline? Well, except if you're a veterinary, I would expect not many. I believe that specialised networks and communities have much more impact in their niche, than a giant like Facebook does, simply because there's less noise.</p>\n<p>Have a look at <em>Reddit</em>, <em>Hacker News</em>, <em>StackOverflow</em> and more recently <em>Product Hunt</em>. Their user numbers might not be counted in billions or even millions, but the <em>traction</em> the content posted in their network has is amazing. So if I would want to promote a product/an album/whatever I would push it first to the specialised networks because that's where you will get the best feedback and engagement.</p>\n<p>In the end, it's all about the value you get from using one platform or another and you have to consider that well, don't look only at user numbers. And if none of the existing medias don't make sense, build your own! There's a <em>good guide</em> out there on how to build your own community, inspired by the success of Product Hunt and Reddit.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>The Four Horsemen video:</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCvwCcEP74Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCvwCcEP74Q</a><br>\n<em>source for users data:</em> <a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/resource-how-many-people-use-the-top-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ExpandedRamblings</a><br>\n<em>source for Facebook revenue:</em> <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-s-mobile-revenue-hits-2-5-billion-prices-soar/296869/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-s-mobile-revenue-hits-2-5-billion-prices-soar/296869/</a><br>\n<em>how your content is filtered by Facebook, Google and others:</em> <a href=\"http://www.thefilterbubble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.thefilterbubble.com/</a><br>\n<em>Reddit:</em> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.reddit.com/</a><br>\n<em>Hacker News:</em> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a><br>\n<em>StackOverflow:</em> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a><br>\n<em>Product Hunt:</em> <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.producthunt.com/</a><br>\n<em>traction:</em> read about one of the stories from Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bramk/how-i-launched-the-2-most-upvoted-product-of-all-time-on-product-hunt-f3772fb20ad8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How I launched the #2 most upvoted product of all time on Product Hunt.</a><br>\n<em>good guide:</em> <a href=\"http://www.communitybuildingguide.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.communitybuildingguide.com/</a></p>\n",

Recently, I started testing <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RescueTime</a> out of curiosity to see how much of my time is spent on &quot;productive&quot; things and how much on not so productive things.</p>\n<p>Not much later I found myself refreshing the <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RescueTime</a> dashboard every now and then to see how much I score on their stats. But that wasn't too convenient, not to mention productive! __</p>\n<p>After a short period of time where I used a <a href=\"http://blink1.thingm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blink(1)</a> connected to my <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RescueTime</a> account as a basic representation of my perceived productivity, I said, &quot;Hey, why don't I use Pebble for this?&quot;. So that's how I got to do the simple <a href=\"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54eccb83732a680613000007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&quot;Rescued by Pebble&quot;</a> watchface.</p>\n<p>The watchface connects to the API provided by <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RescueTime</a> and determines how productive you were in the last 5 minutes. The data returned contains how many seconds you have spent in different levels of productivity. From this data I calculate a weighted average which later on I display in the watchface as a progress bar and it influences which of the 4 faces you see on display.</p>\n<p>So now I try to keep my Pebble smiling all the time!</p>\n<p>P.S. I plan to release several updates to it, like vibration when the productivity is low and show offline time as well</p>\n<p>P.P.S My code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/rescued-by-pebble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github</a>, so if you're interested, go check it out!</p>\n<p>P.P.P.S Pff, by the time I released this watchface, a new <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises/description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pebble</a> watch is out and soon another SDK.

Now, to be honest, I don't know if Spotify is fair or not, there's plenty of pro articles as well as against this topic, but that's besides the point.</p>\n<p>Let's say that Spotify doesn't pay fair, let's just assume that this is the uncontestable truth. Ok?</p>\n<p>What can the artists do? Should only the artists do something? Or maybe also the consumers should do something? Based on our hypothesis above, I would say both.</p>\n<p>But is the consumer likely to ditch Spotify in a sign of protest? I mean in mass, in large numbers, in such a way that it makes a difference and proves a point. If you think about it, Spotify comes and gives you access to pretty much any music ever released, anytime you want it, however you want it and the punchline, somewhat for &quot;free&quot;. And if you used to use piracy to get your music, it removes even the guilt of doing something illegal (for those who even felt it). If you're really into it, here, unlimited access for almost nothing.</p>\n<p>Let's make another assumption, what if the consumer doesn't do anything? I mean, more and more users go to Spotify, pay the fee or don't pay the fee, but they get to listen the music. And say, &quot;hey, nice piano man, cool music you have, I won't buy your album, I'll stream it from Spotify and maybe drop by your concerts sometimes&quot;.</p>\n<p>What then?</p>\n<p>The only alternative I see is for the artists to come up with an alternative. Let's face it, most of the big labels will stick with Spotify and in the end the discussion here is not really about the big names in music, but about the smaller ones.</p>\n<p>I find it pointless for the artists to simply stick to the old ways of doing business (mostly offline) while mumbling threat words at Spotify that it doesn't pay them or not even loading their music there. There are alternatives that catch up, my favourite: <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BandCamp</a>. The artist gets paid directly, while BC gets a flat fee.</p>\n<p>But even if you don't like any of the alternatives on the market, build your own corner where you stream your music and people can pay and get access to it NOW, technology has become very cheap and let's face it, you probably won't have million of listeners.

      "title": "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People",
      "content_html": "<p>By accident, like most of the books I read, I stumbled upon Stephen Covey's book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It's one of <em>those books</em>, it's not enough to read them, or at least not just once, but you also should think deeply about the ideas in them and apply them into your life.</p>\n<p>It's not the first time I mention Covey's book, I have shared <em>fragments</em> from it and even gave an <em>extremely short summary</em> of the main concepts:</p>\n<pre><code>You have to be proactive, to be aware that you can make the choice of how you act, no matter what environment you’re in. \nYou have to set a personal statement for yourself, just imagine you’re at your funeral, what would you like everyone to remember you for? \nYou have to focus on the most important things, not just urgent, of course you know what’s important, you just set up your personal statement before!\n\nOnce you have all these figured out, time to think about the others. Think win-win, no matter who you’re dealing with. Be a good listener, be empathic and think about the whole, not just about yourself or some other person, but the whole, synergy! And to complete the picture, you have to keep yourself fit, body, mind, soul.\n</code></pre>\n<p>That basically sums up all the 7 habits: 3 for yourself, 3 for the relations with others and 1 to keep the wheels spinning. You have to look further than the names of the habits, there are plenty of aspects which don't really pop-up in your mind just by reading those. I'm going to mention some of them below, I hope just enough to make you want to read more! __</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_1_be_proactive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 1: be proactive</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_1_be_proactive\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 1: be proactive”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>There are multiple sides to being proactive. The obvious one, given by the name, is to act in advance of a situation from the future. It's as simple as paying your bills early or on time, because you know that you will get fined otherwise, although there usually there's a grace period. You know that an unfortunate situation might come, you search solutions in advance and take action to prevent it from happening.</p>\n<p>At the same, being proactive means to not be reactive. To not just react to stimuli from your environment as it is predicted, but realise that you have a choice regarding if and how to react to them. Looking around, in some environments, it is expected for women to be housewives and to take care of children, while men provide for the family and make all the important decisions. In these societies, a lot of people follow this path, even if they agree with it or not, because it feels like there is no choice, it's something given.</p>\n<p>Of course, that is an extreme example, but at a deeper analysis of ourselves, and especially when interacting with people from a different culture than ours, we start noticing some of the things that we do/think, just because of the environment we come from.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_2_begin_with_the_end_in_mind\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 2: begin with the end in mind</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_2_begin_with_the_end_in_mind\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 2: begin with the end in mind”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>What's maybe even more important to realise, is that whatever decisions we make, or thoughts we have, they are all influenced by the conditioning we got from the environment. Parents, family, friends, school, religion, culture, they all put one or more bricks in the foundation of our self.</p>\n<p>Once we realise these tendencies we have or we have internalised, call them values or paradigms, we can test them and why not, improve them.</p>\n<p>Why is it important? Because it makes it much easier to identify what we want to accomplish in our life and to achieve our goals this way. Habit #2 is about defining our personal statement, for all our roles (parent, friend, software engineer etc) and set goals. It means to &quot;keep your eyes on the target&quot; while constantly revising the target and it's underlying paradigms and values.</p>\n<p>I've never been very strict with my personal goals, maybe also because I'm still figuring some of the things out, but I can understand the benefits of creating a personal statement which guides my actions, like the carrot that motivates the donkey to keep moving in the right direction. Of course, it depends on you how detailed you want to make it and how often you want to revise it. Stephen Covey mentions in his book that he and his wife had a family statement, which they constantly revised, in order to keep themselves focused on what is important.</p>\n<p>As a side note, Dr. Covey had 9 kids and 43 grandchildren, he died in 2012 at 80 years old, as cofounder of a successful company with offices in 123 countries[1].</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_3_put_first_things_first\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 3: put first things first</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_3_put_first_things_first\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 3: put first things first”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Once you are aware you can change things (habit 1) and you know where you want to head to (habit 2), then it's time to get to action. I did an exercise for a couple of days: at the end of the day, I looked at the list of things I did that day. Most of the things were urgent, they required immediate action. But were they important for me or for my goals, as a person or as a member of my team/company?</p>\n<p>One of the points Covey makes in this chapter is that a lot of us spend their time on things that are urgent and apparently important. Always putting out fires and solving crises. But where we should spend our time mostly is in the area of not urgent things but important. These are the actions that will get us closer to our goals in an effective way. It's about doing important things before the &quot;knife gets to the bone&quot; as a Romanian proverb says.</p>\n<p>In the business world, the first 3 habits are mandatory for someone who wants to be a good manager and leader as defined by <em>Peter Drucker</em>, also quoted in Covey's book:</p>\n<pre><code>Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"habit_4_think_win-win\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 4: think win-win</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_4_think_win-win\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 4: think win-win”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Habits 4, 5 and 6 are about our interaction with others. It's very important to have habits 1, 2 and 3 well under control before we move on to others, as in Stephen Covey's opinion, you cannot improve your relationships with others, until your are well grounded on your feet.</p>\n<p>Habit #4 encourages you to approach every situation that involves other parties with a win-win solution in mind. You win and the others involved win as well.</p>\n<p>I found the chapter of this habit one of the hardest to read. There are a lot of details and dimensions to this, which are very difficult to grasp after only one read. I do recall that going for a win-win is a combination of consideration for the other and courage. In the end, you will win more, because you build trust and create long-lasting partnerships or relationships.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are situations when other approaches are more suitable and Covey goes through all of them quite thoroughly. There's a book that I started recently and left it somewhere in-between called <em>Give and Take</em>, by <em>Adam Grant</em>, which elaborates why givers have more to win than takers[2].</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_5_seek_first_to_understand_then_to_be_understood\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 5: seek first to understand, then to be understood</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_5_seek_first_to_understand_then_to_be_understood\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 5: seek first to understand, then to be understood”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>In order to go for a win-win, you need to listen, but not just let the words fly by, you need to understand! I find myself some times pushing my ideas to the ones around me without taking the time to listen and understand first. Or there are times when I speak with someone and I realize that what I say is simply ignored, even though sometimes we say the same thing. Not really a communication at all, more like a monologue, isn't it?</p>\n<p>And there is another aspect: once you understood their point of view, you can make your point by building up around their view. This shows that you care about their opinion and you take time to understand it, you don't just shove your words into their ears, ignoring them, their feelings, their opinions.</p>\n<p>And it's not just about words, because a lot of the exchange of information done in a conversation is through <em>non-verbal means</em>. Our bodies speak for themselves, that's why empathy plays an important role in successful conversations. Being able to &quot;feel&quot; the feelings of the people involved in your communication allows you to create a better connection with them, by acknowledging their feelings and this way creating a deeper interaction with them.</p>\n<p>I've read about the concept of deeper listening in other books in the past: I recommend <em>Difficult Conversations</em>, by a group of authors from <em>Harvard Negotiation Project</em>. Listening is vital in a successful negotiation.<br>\nAlso, <em>Chade-Meng Tan</em>, <em>The Jolly-Good-Fellow</em> of Google, talks about listening and understanding in <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_6_synergize\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 6: synergize</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_6_synergize\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 6: synergize”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>I'm not sure I got the full meaning of the concept of synergy, as presented by Stephen Covey, but I'll explain as much as I got. From my point of view, habit #6 is an escalation of habit #4 and cannot happen without practicing habit #5. It's about thinking of the greater good, the interests of the group and not just yours. It's about doing things together, towards a goal, out of which everyone has to gain and &quot;what results is bigger than the sum of the parts&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit_7_sharpen_the_saw\" tabindex=\"-1\">Habit 7: sharpen the saw</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#habit_7_sharpen_the_saw\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Habit 7: sharpen the saw”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>One of the concepts found all over the book is the P/PC balance. P stands for <em>production</em> and PC means <em>production capability</em> and Stephen Covey describes what he means with them by telling <em>Aesop's fable</em> about the goose and the golden eggs. We are the goose and our work are the golden eggs. It's important to keep these in balance: you work too much, you get many golden eggs, but the goose will burn-out at some point and so go your golden eggs, maybe permanently.</p>\n<p>Habit #7 is about keeping the goose in shape from a mental, physical, social/emotional and spiritual perspective. And most of the time is about not urgent but important activities in your life, that bring long term benefits and slowly burn us down if not done.</p>\n<p>The book is filled with gems of wisdom and interesting situations and if the 7 habits don't mean much to you, you should read it anyway, not just once, maybe several times, it will make you richer in a spiritual way, at least.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Most of this data taken from his book, 2004 edition. ↩</li>\n<li>It's an interesting book, as far as I read, I will get back with a review soon! ↩</li>\n</ol>\n",

All habits have a component of reflection on yourself or on the others and that you should take time to analyse, to refresh, exercise and so on.</p>\n<p>Then I realise that he mentioned 2 things and I didn’t let him finish even the first one. So I asked, “And what’s the second one?”</p>\n<p>At which he smiles and says, “You see, you’re a good listener! The second thing that I wanted to add was to let some things also to chance, have some fun! You don't have to have everything figured out until the end!&quot;</p>\n<p>I didn't want to interupt him again, especially that he was right.

Once you're &quot;successful&quot;, you'll probably enjoy it for a little while and then jump in towards another successful experience. What is important is to take the time to enjoy the ride and don't think only about the destination or reaching that state of being successful, whatever that means.</p>\n<p><code>We thought of life by analogy with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, the thing was to get to that end! Success, or whatever it is, or maybe heaven after you're dead. But we missed the point, the whole way along!

      "content_html": "<p>Some of these things are so simple that are easy to ignore, other are a little bit too abstract to act on them right away. It depends on each of us to act on the things we believe in, to make it our mission to fight for our ideas. Millions of books have been written about these subjects, yet most of the modern workers continue to ignore them. I’m going to add another drop to the ocean of recipes of presumed success, here it goes, take it with a bit of hope:</p>\n<pre><code>  1. Burnout guard - let’s inform everyone how to recognise possible burnouts, acknowledge it and take measures. Make it OK to be tired, find a way to set a tempo that is maintainable, don’t abandon your people on the way\n  2. Let’s make it visual - define goals, visions, values for our products or services to have everyone aligned on what we want to accomplish with them. Next step: same for the company. But besides everything, communicate them and put them on every square inch of the offices, shout them out loud and proud, repeat them until you’re out of breath\n  3. Feed it back - educate on how to give feedback, positive or negative, right on the spot, when the situation allows it. The difficulty is to recognise these moments when they happen and take action\n  4. Work smart not late - working late doesn’t mean you do more. Most of the time you create the work that you’ll have to fix later by staying late.\n  5. Knowledge is power - find a way to share all the knowledge accumulated by the people with all the other people in the company - do workshops, trainings, discussions, coffee chats, take time to share at every level\n  6. Learn to let go - delegate, share responsibility and successes, but also let people fail.\n  7. Meetings are poison - don’t organise a meeting unless it’s really necessary! Educate on how to structure meetings, announce the goal and agenda beforehand, but most of all, announce the length of the meeting and stick to it! Time is the most important resource a person has, don’t waste everyone else’s time just because you don’t have time. Take the extra minute to save hours!\n  8. Treat things for what they are - a burnout is a burnout, as a white lie is still a lie. Don’t wrap it in something nicer, so you’re not forced to accept the facts. This is the only thing stopping you to take action, the earlier you acknowledge the truth and accept it, the earlier you are able to get over it.\n</code></pre>\n",

The book is basically a collection of posts he did on <a href=\"http://hbr.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business Review</a> along the years, starting with <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the one</a> that has the same title as the book and was initially published in 1998.</p>\n<p>The trouble with all these books is that if you don't do something concrete with them right away, you'll probably forget most of their content. Because I don't have time to reread them all the time, I decided some time ago to do mind maps, so I can quickly remind myself what the book was about. That didn't work out all the time, but the first article from this book &quot;screamed&quot; for one, so there it is. You can glimpse it in the cover or download it from <a href=\"http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/What%20makes%20a%20leader%3F.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the subjects of leadership or emotional intelligence (EQ), I urge you to read it!</p>\n",

It's not that I don't like the genre, but I seem to feel guilty because I don't read something &quot;serious&quot; instead. There's also the search of something to read, going through top 10 lists, New York Times best sellers list and so on. Ohh, I'm not a big fan of doing that. But then I discovered the <a href=\"https://storybundle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Story Bundle</a>, a curated collection of books, which is released from time to time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the_bundle\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE bundle</h1>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_bundle\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “THE bundle”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>There are several cool things about the bundle. First of all, it's a curated collection of books of a certain genre. So someone actually spent time putting this bundle together and selected the titles for you, so you don't have to do it.</p>\n<p>Second, all the books are available in several ebook formats, WITHOUT DRM, which means you can read them on whatever device you wish. One of the reasons I chose to buy a Kobo Aura, was to be able to easily read on it any kind of ebook format, with or without DRM, but also to have access to a huge ebook store that integrates very well with the reader.</p>\n<p>And third, you can pay as much as you want on the bundle. There's a minimum amount (which is amazingly low considering what you get) and if you pay more than the average value, you get the bonus books. You can also choose to donate a part of the money to charity.</p>\n<p>I'll be honest, I've never heard of most of the authors from the bundles I bought until now (about 5 or 6) and I was a little bit reluctant about the quality of the writings. But after reading some of them without being able to put the reader down, I can tell you that most of the books I read are really well written.</p>\n<p>These being said, I'll let you go check it out and I'll go take care of my own business, I'm a little bit behind with my reading! ;-)</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>It was a dark rainy night. You could hear some stray dogs howling, probably annoyed as well by the heavy rain. Everyone was at home. Well, except us, me and Marcel. We were getting ready for what was supposed to be my first live deployment since I joined Codis.</p>\n<p>“It needs to be done during the night, when our users are busy fucking, living their pitiful worry-less lives! What do they care when we do updates, as long as everything WORKS!!”, said Dirk, our boss, during the pep talk he delivered to us in the morning, in preparation to our task.</p>\n<p>It seems that George, the operations dude, was sick. In any of these situations, we, the ‘developers’ slash ‘software engineers’, are supposed to handle any live deployment of our cooking platform. Who would’ve thought that serving a bunch of recipes to housewives all over the world was so mission critical to require 100% uptime or engineers to lose sleep! Nevertheless, the company did some studies and it seems that the time between 23 and 0 is perfect for such things. So there we were.</p>\n<p>We fired up the build early at 21:00 hours and started enjoying our pepperoni pizza, from the house, while watching the latest 3 episodes of House. The build was going to take a while. It would have been a pity to waste the time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The first Exception started showing up a few minutes after the deployment was done on the first of our nodes. It was a damn ugly stacktrace, a few screens long, pointing to some goddamn errors in the source code. I glanced to Marcel, my colleague of suffering for that night:</p>\n<p>“Do you know this one? ”</p>\n<p>You see, no application is bug or error free, some of them are showing up just because some other developer screwed up, not our personal fault. So we got used to coexist with some of these inoffensive little buggers, as long as they didn’t damage too much the performance.</p>\n<p>“Nope, this is new. Maybe it’s the cache!!!”</p>\n<p>Whenever a new big architectural change is done to the system, it automatically becomes the number one possible cause for all the failures of the system in the next few months. And just 2 weeks ago, we added a caching system to make the perform better.</p>\n<p>“Not possible, the guys tested it for 2 WEEKS! The cache works perfectly! This MUST be something else!”, I said, wishing to be right.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fast forward three hours later, we were still debugging the application trying to identify the cause of the ugly situation we were facing. We got a few hints about where the issue might be, but we weren’t able to exactly pin point it yet. Not really the perfect way to spend your night. I was already thinking to ditch the damn thing, put the old version back, go home and face Dirk’s wrath next morning when…</p>\n<p>“Found the stupid mother fucker!”, shouts Marcel with a mix of exasperation and uncontrolled joy. “It was the cache all along, seems that the propagation strategy does not work quite right with the latest changes”.</p>\n<p>Pff, the propagation strategy. With all the rush to deliver, there was no time left for setting up a full replica of the live node environment to test how the cache behaves with any new features. But hey, we got it now and we could fix it on the live environment without making a new build.</p>\n<p>An hour later, we were on our way home, morning breaking soon. We managed to spend 20 hours in a row in the office that day. A record I was not particularly eager to repeat any time soon!</p>\n<p>*<em>Bitopia is 100% fictional, all the characters, product names and companies don’t exist in real life. However, the situations depicted here do have some shred of reality in them.</em></p>\n",

Yeah, I know, who would have thought, right? But that's besides the point.</p>\n<p>Initially I used a writer specific app for Mac called <a href=\"http://www.ulyssesapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ulysses</a> and while the app is really great, it has two disadvantages:</p>\n<pre><code>  * it is available only for Mac (and maybe in the future for iOS)\n  * not geeky enough (I know this is a stretch for a second reason, but hey!, I'm still a programmer)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I ended up using <a href=\"http://asciidoctor.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AsciiDoc(tor)</a>. I flirted a bit with the idea of using it before, but the editor support kept me away (<a href=\"http://macromates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TextMate</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GEdit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VIM</a>). After a while though, I decided to try it out with <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GEdit</a>, which can work on pretty much on any Unix/Linux platform.</p>\n<p>I did more than that, I refurbished a 7 year old laptop of mine into a so called &quot;word processor&quot;. A computer on which I am not allowed (self-imposed) to use anything else than writing related software, so no Facebook access, no Twitter, no RSS, no nothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now_the_good_stuff\" tabindex=\"-1\">Now the good stuff</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#now_the_good_stuff\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Now the good stuff”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Instead of using the vanilla version of <a href=\"http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AsciiDoc</a>, I opted in for <a href=\"http://asciidoctor.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AsciiDoctor</a> ruby gem which offers a few things on top. In case you don't know, <a href=\"http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AsciiDoc</a> is a text document format, like Markdown, but it offers all the tools needed for writing longer pieces, like a book. The nice thing about it is that it's basically plain text with some basic markup and you can convert it to basically any format.</p>\n<p>You can, but it is not always easy. I set up everything pretty much as described on the <a href=\"http://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AsciiDoctor page</a>, using the <a href=\"http://rubydoc.info/gems/guard/frames\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guard</a> gem and <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Epiphany</a> for live preview. And it works great!</p>\n<h3 id=\"troubleshooting\" tabindex=\"-1\">Troubleshooting</h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#troubleshooting\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Troubleshooting”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Up till now, I didn't find too many things that weren't covered by documentation.

(I guess there must be a way to get the styling as well through the API, but for something that it doesn't change and that I'll probably throw away, I didn't spend much time for it)</p>\n<p>So run at least once the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;asciidoctor -a linkcss mysample.adoc\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>-a linkcss</code> option will tell the CLI to not set the CSS inline, but rather in a CSS file called <em>asciidoctor.css</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the_bigger_one_-_converting_to_pdf_and_customizing_the_fonts\" tabindex=\"-1\">The bigger one - converting to PDF and customizing the fonts</h4>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the_bigger_one_-_converting_to_pdf_and_customizing_the_fonts\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “The bigger one - converting to PDF and customizing the fonts”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>While ending up with a HTML is very easy, generating a PDF is not that instant:</p>\n<pre><code>  * first convert to the DocBook format,\n  * use [asciidoctor-fopub](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub) for the rest\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you set it up, things are pretty easy, unless you want to have special characters like <code>ţ</code>. Then you're into trouble:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;WARNING: Glyph &quot;ţ&quot; (0x163, tcedilla) not available in font &quot;Times-Roman&quot;.\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You end up seeing a <code>#</code> in your pdf document. After a quick check, I found out that <a href=\"http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache FOP</a>, the tool used to do the final conversion to PDF, supports only a handful of font families: Helvetica (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Times (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Courier (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Symbol and ZapfDingbats[1].</p>\n<p>So how do you setup custom fonts using the whole toolchain we've put together?<br>\nSimple!</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, you need to know that there is a way to pass parameters directly to FOP through <a href=\"https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asciidoctor-fopub</a>, using the <code>-param</code> parameter. You can read more <a href=\"https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub#custom-xsl-parameters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, some of these parameters can configure the font families used in different areas of the document, like the title or the body. Check this out:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;fopub docbook.xml -param body.font.family Alegreya -param title.font.family AlegreyaSans\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you do just that, you'll get a lot of warnings that Alegreya fonts cannot be found and the end result will be the same, no <code>ţ</code> in your text. There's one more piece to the puzzle!</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, copy the <code>docbook-xsl</code> folder from your local copy of the <a href=\"https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asciidoctor-fopub</a> into a different location and start customize it.</p>\n<p>You will find there a magical file called <code>fop-config.xml</code> and in this file you can define custom fonts for <a href=\"http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache FOP</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya sans/AlegreyaSans-Regular.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;AlegreyaSans&quot; style=&quot;normal&quot; weight=&quot;normal&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya sans/AlegreyaSans-Bold.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;AlegreyaSans&quot; style=&quot;normal&quot; weight=&quot;bold&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;code&gt;&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya/Alegreya-Regular.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;Alegreya&quot; style=&quot;normal&quot; weight=&quot;normal&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya/Alegreya-Italic.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;Alegreya&quot; style=&quot;italic&quot; weight=&quot;normal&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya/Alegreya-Bold.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;Alegreya&quot; style=&quot;normal&quot; weight=&quot;bold&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;font kerning=&quot;yes&quot; embed-url=&quot;/toolchain/fonts/alegreya/Alegreya-BoldItalic.ttf&quot; embedding-mode=&quot;subset&quot;&gt;\n           &lt;font-triplet name=&quot;Alegreya&quot; style=&quot;italic&quot; weight=&quot;bold&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, <code>embed-url</code> should point to the location where the font files are present. <strong>WARNING:</strong> Apache FOP doesn't support OTF fonts yet, so you should use TTF.</p>\n<p>After that, update the <code>fopub</code> call with the path to your <code>docbook-xsl</code> and you're good to go!</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;fopub -t /home/alex/Dropbox/Writing/Bitopia/toolchain/docbook-xsl/ docbook.xml -param body.font.family Alegreya -param title.font.family AlegreyaSans\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>more details on the Apache FOP <a href=\"http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/trunk/fonts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help page</a> ↩</li>\n</ol>\n",

I think that you need to exercise, never-mind how you spend your day.</p>\n<p>Recently I started using a standing desk at work as well, which means I stand on my feet for quite some time daily. The first week was relatively painful, because your body is not used to the new posture, so I started to do some basic stretching exercises, every morning, some of the evenings and during the day.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like to think it is a change for the better, for the daily exercise, if not for anything else.

I went to his desk and in 5 minutes, problem was solved! You would be tempted to say, &quot;Whoaaa, man, you're very good! Solving that dude's problem in a few minutes after he spent hours working it!&quot;.</p>\n<p>Well, actually I didn't do anything. My colleague fixed his problem on his own. He first broke his loop of thought by calling for help. While I was at his desk, he started presenting me &quot;THE problem&quot;, by going through the code, like he probably did many times before by himself, trying to identify the issue, adding some more log statements. But this time, because I was there, while he was explaining me what he was trying to accomplish, I think he was also trying to predict some of my questions. And so, he tried some other things than before and there it was, right in front of him!</p>\n<h2 id=\"strange\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strange?</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#strange\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Strange?”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It happens to me quite often to be very involved in doing something and to spend a lot of time circling in the same ideas, without being able to detach and try another angle. A lot of times I had an issue to solve and because I was not able to fix it straight away, I postponed it for the next day[1], when most of the times it would take me moments to find the right idea.</p>\n<p>That's fine, but what do you do when you have a deadline?</p>\n<p>Looking back, at my own similar situations, I think there are 2 actions to take to get closer to a solution:</p>\n<pre><code>  * first, realize that you spend a lot of time going in circles\n  * second, add some random factor to the process\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"tail_chasing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tail chasing</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#tail_chasing\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Tail chasing”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/IMG_0097.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://uphillwriting.org/2011/09/21/story-cycle/dog-chasing-tail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uphillwriting.org</a>As always, in order to fix a problem, you have to realize that you have a problem. When you are very involved in what you're doing and on top of this there's the need to deliver, you'll probably waste a lot of time. The urge to find the solution, to check the box of the task, to make it through, to be a problem solver, is keeping you &quot;there&quot;.</p>\n<p>I will not pretend I have a solution for this, it sounds more like something that can be solved by an increased level of self-awareness, the kind of thing that could be obtained through self-analysis and meditation (e.g. to know when you are angry, before you are angry and take a rational decision: to explode in a rage burst or just show a sorrow smile and move on). While I did read <a href=\"http://www.alexchiri.com/post/great-books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a few books</a> related to this, I never had the determination to try it for a long time, to see if there are any results.</p>\n<p>One more pragmatic approach would be to set a timer each time when you start a new task. Add an alarm for 2 or 3 hours later, or whatever you think it's enough for it and when the time runs out, force yourself to detach, add some random factor to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"random_factor\" tabindex=\"-1\">Random factor</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#random_factor\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Random factor”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><img src=\"http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/IMG_0099.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://photosinbox.com/photos/white-dices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">photosinbox.com</a>The moment you got out of your own mind's captivity, the problem is almost solved.

Try to explain him/her/it the situation in an appropriate way[2], this will definitely give you at least a new angle to try.</p>\n<p>Of course, the help of another specialist in the matter might help you even more, so if you have one available around, don't hesitate to approach him/her. In the end, what I think it matters is to make yourself think differently and the easiest way for me is to bring someone from outside my problem.

Considering this, I think it's safe to say that this wasn't like any regular storm and while this kind of events don't happen very often, its consequences are going to be remembered for many, many years.

A mobile flood barrier on one of the most important commercial routes for the Netherlands: the waterway connecting the North Sea with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Rotterdam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harbour of Rotterdam</a>, the biggest port in the world at that time. This meant that the barrier had to be built in such a way that it didn't hinder the commercial traffic in the area, where any hour of interruption would cost the authorities a great amount of euros (or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guilders</a>, the national currency until it was replaced with euros in 2002).</p>\n<p>The solution came from the BMK consortium (Bouwcombinatie Maeslantkering) who presented the best solution for the requirements of the project. This solution consisted in 2 &quot;pizza slice&quot; shaped constructions, one placed on each banks of the river. The radius of the &quot;pizza slices&quot; is of 273m and each of them is connected to a ball and socket joint weighing 680 tons.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://0f8f28fe275e3a043777-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.r1.cf2.rackcdn.com/IMG_0094.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>A scale model of the barrier</em>[3]In order to move these giants, the bays where the 210 meters long gates stand by are filled with water. When the gates are floating, they are pushed into the middle of the river by a powerful engine. After they reached the desired position, the gates are sunk until they reach the reinforced river bottom. This whole procedure takes about 2.5 hours and reverse is around the same. So in case of a storm during which the level of the water would reach 3m above sea level, the traffic on the river would be closed for at least 5 hours.</p>\n<h1 id=\"see_it_in_action\" tabindex=\"-1\">See it in action</h1>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#see_it_in_action\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “See it in action”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>Since it was completed, Maeslantkering was closed only once due to a storm and even then, the trigger for closing was lowered to 2.6m[4], so the authorities had a chance to test the new &quot;toy&quot;.

Consider lines like &quot;find your passion and never have to work again!&quot; and &quot;quit your day job and find happiness!&quot;. Who wouldn't like to do that, right? It looks like the treasure at the bottom of the rainbow and these books are sold like crazy.</p>\n<p>Well, this book is different! :) First of all, it doesn't promise to magically transform poneys into unicorns (maybe the title is a bit cheesy, we have <a href=\"http://www.stevemartin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steve Martin</a> to thank for that). No, actually if I would have to resume the whole book in a few words, I would say this: if you want to be successful you have to work your ass off and be smart about it and passion will follow. So, first work and then passion, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed Cal's book and it gave me really good ideas to implement in my own life. He was quite methodical in identifying his own path and he interviewed many people. Of course, there's no universal advice and he doesn't even try to sell you one. This book is about the results he got from his research and what works for him, but it's structured in a way that it makes it easy to extrapolate to your own experience.</p>\n<p>And while you're at it, you'd better follow his blog, where he publishes his next accomplishments in his quest of <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decoding patterns of success</a>.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the book <a href=\"http://www.calnewport.com/books/sogood.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> and check out the mindmap below, where I extracted the ideas I considered important.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexchiri/9334391915/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/9334391915_55b47989d9_z.jpg\" alt=\"So good they can't ignore you\"><br>\n</a></p>\n",

I like his way of putting things into words, it's a pleasure to listen and to think about his ideas. Here's one of my favorites that could be resumed to one simple idea: carpe diem!</p>\n<p>[embed]<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/29atSZKbmS4%5B/embed%5D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/29atSZKbmS4[/embed]</a></p>\n<p>I have tried to make a transcript of this video, couldn't grasp a couple of words, sorry for that!</p>\n<p><code>My contention, my personal opinion, this is my basic metaphysical axiom, shall we put it that way. The existence, the physical universe is basically playful. There is no necessity for it whatsoever. It isn't going anywhere, that is to say that it doesn't  have some destination that he ought to arrive at. So then, in music though, one doesn't make the end of a composition, the point of the composition. If that was so, the best of the conductors were those who played fastest. And there would be composers who wrote only finales. People would go to the concerts just to hear a crashing chord, 'cause that's the end. Say when dancing, you don't aim at a particular spot in the room, that's where you should arrive, the whole point of the dancing is the dance. Now, but we don't see that as something brought by our education into our everyday conduct. We got a system of schooling that gives a completely different impression. It's all graded. And what we do is, we put the child in the corridor of this great system, with a kind of 'Come one, kitty, kitty!', and now you are in kindergarten, you know, and that's a great thing, because when you finish that you get into first grade and then, come one!, first grade leads to second grade and so on and you get out of grade school, you got high-school and it's revving up, the thing is coming! Then you gonna get to college, and get into graduate school and when you're through with graduate school you go out and join the world. And then you get into some racket, where you're selling insurance and they got that quota to make and you gonna make that! And all the time, you think 'It's coming, it's coming!', that great thing, the success you're waiting for. And then when you wake up one day, about forty years old, you say 'My God, I've arrived! I'm there!'. And you don't feel very different from what you always felt. And there's a slight let down because you feel is a hoax. And there was a hoax, a dreadful hoax! They made you miss everything! By expectation, look at the people who live to retire, who put those savings away and then when they're 65, they don't have any energy left, they're more or less impotent and they go and rot in an old people's, senior citizens community. And because we simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line. We thought of life by analogy with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, the thing was to get to that end! Success, or whatever it is, or maybe heaven after you're dead. But we missed the point, the whole way along! There was a musical thing and you were suppose to sing, or to dance while the music was being played.</code></p>\n",

But you don't have to trust everybody by their word, you can check it by yourself!</p>\n<p>As you know, when you &quot;compile&quot; your class, the .java file is transformed into a .class file, which is a binary file containing JVM operation codes (each operation is represented by a byte = bytecode). This .class file is interpreted by the JVM and later compiled into machine code at runtime by the Just In Time compiler.</p>\n<p>A good way to see how Java treats internally all this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&quot;syntactic sugar&quot;</a> is to have a look at the bytecode.

A team means multiple members and each can carry so much bags of money. Let's put in code a <em>Heist</em>, a <em>Bank</em> with not enough security and using the new <em>ForkJoinPool</em>, let's parallelize and distribute the tasks between robbers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"phase_1_just_one_heist_team_zip_with_the_source_code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Phase 1: Just one Heist team (<a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/BankRobbers/archive/v1.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zip with the source code</a>)</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#phase_1_just_one_heist_team_zip_with_the_source_code\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Phase 1: Just one Heist team (zip with the source code)”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>As usual, the code can be found on my GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/BankRobbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repository</a>.</p>\n<p>First, let's look at the <em>Bank</em> class, which is pretty simple:</p>\n<p>This bank of ours is really an easy target, all the methods called by the robbers are public, just for the sake of the example.</p>\n<p>Until now, nothing out of the ordinary, I hope the method names are explicit enough. There's one thing I would like you to focus your attention on and that's the <em>Safe</em> class, not just because that's where all the money is:</p>\n<p>You probably noticed by now, it's extending <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>ConcurrentHashMap</em></a> and holds aaalll the CASH. Why concurrent? Well, that's because there's gonna be a bunch of robbers who will access it at the same time. And this type is a bit more efficient than extending HashMap and adding synchronized to all the methods.</p>\n<p>So let's see, we have a <em>Bank</em> with a <em>Safe</em> filled with <em>MoneyBags</em>, well I'd say it's time for a <em>Heist</em>:</p>\n<h3 id=\"forkjoinpool\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ForkJoinPool</a></h3>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#forkjoinpool\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “ForkJoinPool”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>If you take a look at the API docs of this class you'll notice the first phrase: 'An ExecutorService for running ForkJoinTasks.'. Our <em>Heist</em> class is gonna initialize a <em>ForkJoinPool</em> with the number of threads to run a.k.a. number of members of the heist team.</p>\n<p>We got a pool of threads, next step is to put it to work. That's where the <em>Logistics</em> inner class comes in play. There are 2 implementations of the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinTask.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>ForkJoinTask</em></a> class: <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/RecursiveTask.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>RecurrentTask</em></a> and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/RecursiveAction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>RecurrentAction</em></a>. I opted in for the <em>RecurrentAction</em> because I don't need it to return anything after the task is done.</p>\n<p>The thing about <em>ForkJoinPool</em> is that it is useful when you have tasks that can be split more and more in simple tasks. In our case, we take all the amount of _MoneyBag_s the robbers can steal (it's a random number, mind you) and split it in chunks smaller or equal with <em>ROBBER_CAPACITY</em>. All these small tasks then are managed by the pool using the configured number of _Thread_s, or in our case the robbers the team has. Each robber will pick a task like this when the pool is dictating it, you'll notice it better in the output after we run the show.</p>\n<p>Speaking of running, we only need the <em>CrimeSetup</em> class and the fun can start:</p>\n<p>One of the possible output after running it would be this:</p>\n<p>How nice from the robbers to leave some money behind!</p>\n<h2 id=\"phase_2_multiple_heists_at_the_same_time_same_bankzip_with_the_source_code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Phase 2: Multiple heists at the same time, same bank(<a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/BankRobbers/archive/v2.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zip with the source code</a>)</h2>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#phase_2_multiple_heists_at_the_same_time_same_bankzip_with_the_source_code\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Phase 2: Multiple heists at the same time, same bank(zip with the source code)”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p><strong>Please note, that even though it doesn't show below, the <em>Heist</em> class has suffered a very small change which was not relevant for Phase 1, but prevents a deadlock in Phase 2. Check the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/BankRobbers/blob/master/src/main/java/com/alexchiri/robber/Heist.java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repo</a> or the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/BankRobbers/archive/v2.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sources</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>I remember seeing a few months ago or more, a stupid movie about two teams of bank robbers trying to hit the same bank at the same time. :) Of course it ended up in a mess.</p>\n<p>If we would add a few more teams targeting the same bank simultaneously, we would probably get some really confusing results. As it is now, the access to the money is synchronized, the problem is that between the time the robbers evaluate how much money they can steal and the time they actually do it, another team might already be finished with the safe. Plus, they would probably shoot each other and we don't want a bloodbath, don't we?</p>\n<p>So let's make them wait for each other, there's money for everybody, why not be civil? In order to do this, we can use a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReentrantLock</a> which is an implementation of the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lock</a> interface. <strong>Reentrant</strong> means that a Thread can acquire the same lock multiple times. Otherwise said, if a class uses the same instance of the <em>ReentrantLock</em> to secure more of its methods, a Thread can access them all, it doesn't need to wait for himself to release the lock after acquiring it once (that would be a nice <strong>Deadlock</strong>!). For us <strong>Reentrant</strong> is not useful, we lock only one method, which is not revisited, but this is the simplest implementation Java has for <em>Lock</em>.</p>\n<p>To make it clear, here's the final version of the <em>Bank</em> class:</p>\n<p>We add the lock in the <em>openSafeUnderGunpoint</em> method and we unlock when the robbery is almost done, in the <em>wrapUp</em> method. And this works just fine, because all the <em>Heist</em> threads have the same entry point so each team will wait for the previous one to release the lock on the <em>Bank</em>.</p>\n<p>Don't forget adding multiple threads:</p>\n<p>And you would get something like this:</p>\n",

We had a few tens of vinyls, most of them 'classics' like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C0BC2489EC07740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harry Belafonte</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eltonjohn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elton John</a>, <a href=\"http://www.roxette.se/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roxette</a>, <a href=\"http://www.abbasite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abba</a> and a bunch of children stories recorded for the radio, sometime in the '60s or '70s.</p>\n<p>You could guess which were my favorites at that time, I knew them by heart and a day wouldn't pass without the player 'booming' with children stories. A couple of months ago, I found accidentally on YouTube my favorite story from those vinyls and without being able to move a muscle I listened mesmerized to those 'gods' voices, while memories were flowing before my eyes.</p>\n<p>The truth is that after playing one vinyl a few times, I was able to easily jump to the parts that I liked just by lifting the player's arm and placing the head were I wanted. It started with the stories, but while I got older I savaged the music discs without mercy and I guess that is where my weakness for the 80s music comes from, but this is not subject of this post.</p>\n<h4 id=\"more_or_less\" tabindex=\"-1\">More or less</h4>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#more_or_less\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “More or less”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>It won't be much of a surprise for you what I'm going to say next, but here it goes! In the age of Spotify and YouTube, I realize that content is less memorable. If you ask me to mumble a song that I liked in the last 2 years, it will be quite hard and it's not because there weren't any good songs out there. At the same time, I can reproduce most of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Matilda&quot; easily, even though I didn't listen to it in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>There are (at least) 2 factors at work here:</p>\n<pre><code>  1. Abundance. There's too much content we can get our hands on instantly and that's good but it's also bad, 'cause less sticks with you.\n  2. Format. The current format of distribution for music is not helping your memory. The only trigger is the actual content.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know it's not feasible to return to the vinyl era and I also know that this is just another <code>less is more</code> post, but I felt the need to just say it as well.</p>\n",

You probably know that there's a specification for this, namely <a href=\"http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JSR-330</a> and you surely know what Dependency Injection is (let's call it DI from now on).</p>\n<p>If not, to put it short, DI allows you make your classes and their dependencies loosely coupled. Let's say you have the class Company which has one Employee:</p>\n<p>In this case, the Company is forced to use all the time the same type of Employee. You cannot easily 'hire' in place an ExperiencedDeveloper, subclass of Employee, without changing the whole Company. So what if we could inject any kind of Employee into the Company, without affecting the logic of the Company?</p>\n<p>The simplest DI example is the constructor which gets an instance of the dependency class:</p>\n<p>But wouldn't be nice to have something to take care for you of instantiating your dependencies? That's where Inversion of Control containers come in, the favorite of the day: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Guice</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"farming_with_guice\" tabindex=\"-1\">Farming with Guice</h4>\n<a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#farming_with_guice\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Permalink to “Farming with Guice”</span> <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></a><p>By the way, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Guice</a> is the Reference Implementation for the <code>JSR-330 Dependency Injection in Java</code> specification so if you want something more advanced you might want to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spring</a> and <a href=\"http://picocontainer.codehaus.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PicoContainer</a>.</p>\n<p>These being said, let's go to our example. Let's say we have a <em>Farmer</em>, who has a <em>Farm</em> and a <em>Land</em>. Every year he works the land and he gets _Crop_s. But the _Crop_s he gets depend on the type of <em>Weather</em> he has and the <em>Weather</em> is controlled by God. So we can safely say (figuratively speaking), that God injects the <em>Weather</em> in his <em>Farm</em>. And the <em>Farmer</em> would have to manage with whatever he gets, right?</p>\n<p>Let's put this into code! The complete project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/FarmingDependencyInjection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> on my <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a> account.</p>\n<p>So we have a <em>Farm</em>:</p>\n<p>Notice the <code>@Inject</code> annotation before the constructor, that will inject our <em>Weather</em> into our <em>Farm</em>. Here's the <em>Weather</em> interface which has 3 implementations(DryWeather, MildWeather and WetWeather):</p>\n<p>You probably guessed, different weather implementation, different types of _Crop_s in different quantities. But who says what <em>Weather</em> should be injected and from were? We would need a <code>com.google.inject.AbstractModule</code> implementation for that. In our case, the <em>Land</em>:</p>\n<p>The <em>Land</em> says that a <code>com.google.inject.Provider</code>, in our case <em>GodFactor</em>, is responsible for providing our needed <em>Weather</em> instances:</p>\n<p>I'm not sure God makes his decisions this way, but for this case let's say that the type of <em>Weather</em> is decided considering a random number and it's rest after the division by 3.</p>\n<p>The last important piece in our little experiment is the <em>Farmer</em>. How does he manage his <em>Farm</em>?</p>\n<p>The first thing he must do is get the <code>Injector</code> from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guice</a> and use it to get an instance to its <em>Farm</em> and then collect the _Crop_s. So if we run this nice <em>Farm</em> for 5 years (the rest of the classes I didn't present, <em>Weather</em> subclasses and <em>Crop</em>, you can see on the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexchiri/FarmingDependencyInjection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>) we would get something like this:</p>\n<p>But wait, our poor <em>Farmer</em> gets a different <em>Farm</em> each year and also the <em>Weather</em> is totally different! That's not normal! Fortunately, we can do something about that. We can set the Scope of the DI to be Singleton, the only implementation of the Scope class. <strong>(Web apps get SESSION and REQUEST scopes as well, but those are in a special jar from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guice</a> with web components.)</strong><br>\nIn order to do this, we modify the <em>Land</em> class:</p>\n<p>Run it now and you get an output similar to this:</p>\n<p>And that would be the end of my little farming with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guice</a> experiment. I hope it helps to easily understand which are the components needed to use DI and which is their role. This example could have been done in a number of other ways, but I let you to discover which are those. :)</p>\n<p>You can read much more about DI online, there are plenty of resources, a Google search away, or to get started you can check out the <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/evans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Well-Grounded Java Developer</a> book.</p>\n",

Basically, it's about HeaRT (Humility, Respect and Trust), the pillars of the efficiency of a team.</p>\n<p>While it would be perfect for all the geeks out there to just take care of their &quot;science&quot;, social skills are sometimes even more important.

David (as well as Daniel Sempere) is led by the events in strange situations and seems to repeat the same mistakes of a mysterious character from the past (character that is presumed dead in the beginning, due to some alleged tragedy). You take that and you add Barceló, Isaac (which is a bit more cheerful), Sempere &amp; Son book shop, the “Cemetery Of Forgotten Books” and, of course, the city of Barcelona (which seems a bit less creepy than in the first novel of the series) and you’ll start to agree with me.</p>\n<p>Moving away from the similarities in the flow of the story and narrative techniques, The Angel’s Game brings at the table a religious theme (you could have guessed from the title) which is inserted using different inexplainable events (or they imply a religious explanation) generated by THE bad character of the novel.</p>\n<p>Now, now, I don’t want to spoil your lecture of this book, because it is indeed a thrilling novel! It’s just I think it’s a bit disappointing, especially because it misses a “happy end”, or at least a real “happy end”.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>We all have difficult conversations everyday, be it with someone who steps in front of you in line or with your boss asking for a raise. Sometimes they don't end as we would have liked it, right?</p>\n<p>How many times we think that the other party is to blame of the result? Well, that's normal, our self-conservation instinct does that to protect us of bad feelings. But that is not generally a good thing, because at the same time cancels any type of self analysis.</p>\n<p>While you might be feeling better after making your assistant a hard time for forgetting to send an important letter that might have earned you a contract, that doesn't really solve your problem. You'll probably fire him without understanding what triggered his mistake, maybe you contributed somehow to this situation, most of the cases that is true.</p>\n<p>These being said, I want to recommend to you an EXTRAORDINARY book exactly about how to handle a difficult conversation: <a href=\"http://difficultconversations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most</a> by a group of authors who work at the <a href=\"http://www.pon.harvard.edu/category/research_projects/harvard-negotiation-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Negotiation Project</a>. It seems we all react pretty much the same in similar situations, like when we have an argument with someone or when we give bad news. The book analyses all these things that stand behind our behavior during a difficult conversation. Of course, each ones situation and experience are different, but all of them can be improved if we keep in mind at least some of the advices in this book.</p>\n<p>The book presents us a lot of practical situations exemplified with different fictional characters, first to identify the mistakes we do and second to improve the result of the conversation, for ALL the parties involved. Because in general everyone involved is right and wrong at the same time. And this happens mostly because we all judge what's around us by filtering it through our &quot;universe&quot; of thoughts, beliefs, experience, which are different of the ones of our partners in conversation.</p>\n<p>While the content of the book can be resumed in different ways (I tried doing that with the mind map present at the bottom of the article), the biggest value have the situations lively described and in which I think you will also recognize yourself.</p>\n",

The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beranger_v4/status/234969291437535233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tweet</a> contained a quote that made me curious:</p>\n<pre><code>People are evil. — Not evil, Fermín objected. Moronic, which isn't quite the same thing.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, after reading the book, I think this is one of the quotes that best describes the ultimate cause of the tragedy from this story Zafón presents to us: human nature. People are blinded by their feelings and pre- and misconceptions. And I think we can talk days and nights about this subject when we refer to the 19th century, when Zafón's heroes tell their story.</p>\n<p>The novel presents two stories: one of Daniel Sempere, our main hero, which is presented through his own eyes and the story of Julian Carax, author of the Shadow of the Wind (!!!). Daniel chooses his writing from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books (a mystical place where all abandoned books from closed bookshops were going) and soon becomes obsessed of Julian's mysterious death and the legends around it.</p>\n<p>While he reveals more and more things from Carax's past, Daniel seems to be cursed to repeat his idol's mistakes, predicting a very grim ending. I will let you discover by yourself if the prediction is true or not. The book is filled with many peculiar characters, each with its own story and specific personality, starting with the two antagonistic characters, cheerful Fermín and cold blooded Inspector Fumero, and ending with Bernarda, Barcelo's maid and future bride of Fermín.</p>\n<p>Without wanting to ruin more your lecture of this novel I want to end this rambling with a fair warning: this is one of those books which will stick to your hands until you meet both of its covers! :)</p>\n",
