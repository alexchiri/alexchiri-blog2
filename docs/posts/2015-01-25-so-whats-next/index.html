<p>Here I am, at the end of the <a href="http://yourturnchallenge.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YourTurnChallenge</a>! Uuuhuu, what a ride! __</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that since about the half of the challenge I stopped using the list of subjects I prepared beforehand because I had other ideas I wanted to write about and those felt better than the ones on the list. That makes me feel very good about myself because I proved that I don't need to worry much about what to write as long as I write. Sounds strange, doesn't it?</p><p>It was great to prove myself that I can ship a blog post every single day for a week, but I don't plan to write daily from now on. One reason for it is that I don't find writing as important as other things I want to work on (like that <a href="http://www.alexchiri.com/post/i-have-an-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idea of mine</a>). I got a lot of positive energy from this challenge and I decided to reopen <a href="http://www.alexchiri.com/the-live-deployment-stories-from-bitopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Culinotopia</a> yet once again.</p><p>I got some plans about writing and it feels good for me so I want to sharpen further this creative skill, by writing a post 3 times a week. I know that forming a habit needs structure and repetition, so I will choose 3 days of the week in which I will deliver a blog post. That doesn't mean I won't write daily, I plan to deliver some longer posts and try some different types of writing, but I won't ship every day.</p><p>It's been great to be part of this young community that formed with <a href="http://www.winniekao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnie</a>'s initiative, hope we'll keep in touch and continue to share and write.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So long, and thanks for all the fish!</a> Â __</p>
