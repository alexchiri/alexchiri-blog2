<p>John Ferguson Smart and Jan Molak in an <a href="https://johnfergusonsmart.com/project-management-triangle-must-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> I stumbled upon today:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&quot;On time, in scope and in budget&quot;. This is the refrain of countless project managers on their LinkedIn profiles: it is the badge of the successful project manager, and they wear it with pride.

It is also a misguided and dangerous idea that invariably encourages a short-sighted and bureaucratic mind-set, detrimental to both project teams and the organisations they serve. 
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Totally agree with the above, it's an aged mindset and it should be adjusted.</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;Ask not: what will this feature cost to build, ask: what will this feature do for my organisation
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>There is a tendency to think about the cost first and about the value of a feature second. You hear a lot of questions like, &quot;How long will this feature take?&quot; when the prioritization decisions should be made on the value first and the time (cost) it takes second.</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;There is no such thing as &quot;scope creep&quot;. There are only folk trying to articulate their growing understanding of the actual business needs. 
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>I agree that scope is something that evolves, because most of the time the deadlines are fixed for a reason. And the only think you can do is to adjust the scope and focus on delivering the minimal value that will make the project accomplish its goals until the deadline.</p><p>But sometimes, there's also scope creep. Features that are not really needed to accomplish the goals, they are just nice to haves that would make the result better, but are not <em>necessary</em> for its success.</p>
