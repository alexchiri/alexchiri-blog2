I noticed that I cannot read always non-fiction, because it is usually harder to digest, so I only do that in the morning (usually in the subway ride to work) when my mind is fresh.</p><p>At the same time, if I only read non-fiction, I feel like I am always thinking about the things I am reading and my mind doesn’t get to disconnect. This affects how well I get to focus on the reading. So I thought of making a habit in reading fiction in the evenings and non-fiction in the mornings. It is not very important how much I read every day, as long as I keep on going (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t break the chain</a>).</p><p>If you’ll check out my <a href="https://goodreads.com/alexchiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodreads</a> profile, you’ll most likely see I have two books that I am currently reading:</p><p><img src="https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-05%20at%2017.30.41.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="so_many_details" tabindex="-1">So many details</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#so_many_details"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “So many details”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Because there are a lot of useful details in the books I read, which I fail to recall most of the time, I found useful to take notes. I tried all kind of approaches for this, but the one that seems to work best for me is using the Kindle apps for phone or tablet and highlighting the bits I like. Selection is too laggy on e-ink readers and I waste too much time on trying to get all the paragraphs I want selected.</p><p>When I finish the book, I export the notes and highlights from my Kindle account and put them in a blog post for sharing, but mostly for my later reference.</p><p>There’s one script I find useful to export the Kindle notes which is called <a href="http://www.norbauer.com/bookcision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bookcision</a>. It’s a bookmark with some JavaScript code that you should run on <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kindle page with the book notes</a> and voilà!: easy exporting.</p><h2 id="bonus_podcasts" tabindex="-1">Bonus: podcasts</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#bonus_podcasts"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “Bonus: podcasts”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Another good source of information is podcasts, there are so many great out there. Unlike other people, I cannot focus on audio books or podcasts while commuting or driving. I focus much better on reading. So I was a little bit behind with my listening, until I had the idea to listen to podcasts while working out in the gym, one day per week. I do my training almost on auto-pilot and it’s usually quiet, so I can focus on the listening. For the more dense podcasts, I take notes between sets in my phone, notes that I also put on my blog.</p><p><img src="https://02f3b4b6141f4e501887-67ab80ec00c7299bd1255995bf933a71.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/IMG_3845.PNG" alt=""></p>
