<p>Sometimes when you're prototyping a new website or a new page, you would like to add a image placeholder, just to see how things fall into place.</p><p>You can use a service like <a href="http://placehold.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">placehold.it</a> or a small javascript like <a href="http://imsky.github.io/holder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holder.js</a>, which spares the extra requests to an external server, not that in development this matters much.</p><p>For example, in order to generate the two placeholders below, you would only need to write the following HTML code:</p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;holder.js/235x120/#bdeeb7:#97be92&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;holder.js/192x120/#b5e9b3:#90ba8f&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
