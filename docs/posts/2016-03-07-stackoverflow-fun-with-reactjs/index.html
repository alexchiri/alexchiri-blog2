<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Abramov</a>'s tweet and with a desire to get better at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactJS</a>, this weekend I became a little bit more active on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1904089/alexandru-chiri%C8%9Bescu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a>.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>The best way to learn a technology is to open its tag on StackOverflow and start helping people.

You are also learning a lot, especially if you actually try to come up with fully working solutions for people's problems. After playing a little bit with <a href="https://jsbin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jsbin.com</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codepen.io</a>, I opted for using codepen, as it works well and it's cheaper than jsbin.</p><p>Here are some of the pens I created:</p><pre><code>  * someone asked how to prevent deep linking when going directly to the link: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/GZoRze
  * an example on how to pass properties to the children component using context: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/WwQVRG
  * some fun with controlled inputs http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/BKjJYj
  * someone wanted to have access to the redux store from a `onEnter` hook handler: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/yOevGZ
  * how to access location in route components: http://codepen.io/alexchiri/pen/zqrEBb
</code></pre><p>These are simply exercises, nothing very complicated, just to illustrate a concept or another with a working example.</p><p><strong>Best takeway</strong> until now: if you want your answer to be selected, make sure you write a clear, succint, to-the-point answer, that the asker can use right away.</p>
