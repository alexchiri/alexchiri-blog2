# The Shadow Of The Wind by Carlos Ruiz-Zafón

*Written on September 1st, 2012.*
tags: #books 


One of the best books I read in the last couple of months, it has all the right elements to be a successful novel.

I found out about this novel from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/beranger_v4/status/234969291437535233) of one of the people I'm following. The [tweet](https://twitter.com/beranger_v4/status/234969291437535233) contained a quote that made me curious:

    
    People are evil. — Not evil, Fermín objected. Moronic, which isn't quite the same thing.


Now, after reading the book, I think this is one of the quotes that best describes the ultimate cause of the tragedy from this story Zafón presents to us: human nature. People are blinded by their feelings and pre- and misconceptions. And I think we can talk days and nights about this subject when we refer to the 19th century, when Zafón's heroes tell their story.

The novel presents two stories: one of Daniel Sempere, our main hero, which is presented through his own eyes and the story of Julian Carax, author of the Shadow of the Wind (!!!). Daniel chooses his writing from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books (a mystical place where all abandoned books from closed bookshops were going) and soon becomes obsessed of Julian's mysterious death and the legends around it.

While he reveals more and more things from Carax's past, Daniel seems to be cursed to repeat his idol's mistakes, predicting a very grim ending. I will let you discover by yourself if the prediction is true or not. The book is filled with many peculiar characters, each with its own story and specific personality, starting with the two antagonistic characters, cheerful Fermín and cold blooded Inspector Fumero, and ending with Bernarda, Barcelo's maid and future bride of Fermín.

Without wanting to ruin more your lecture of this novel I want to end this rambling with a fair warning: this is one of those books which will stick to your hands until you meet both of its covers! :)
