<p><a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone</a> is a Mac OS X app which sits in the menu bar and that allows you to configure a series of actions. You can add these actions in a grid that is shown whenever you drag something on top of the icon in the menu bar. Then you can drop files on these actions and upload the files to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> and others or just keep them until you need them later.</p><p>A month or so ago, I saw an article on <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/07/16/review-dropzone-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Terpstra’s blog</a> about the new <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone 3</a> which was released on 1st of July. I remembered then that I got a license of <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone</a> with one of the <a href="http://macheist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacHeist</a> bundles, but didn’t get me too interested because there weren’t too many actions (or destinations) and none of the existing ones were useful for me. Of course, I could’ve created one but I wasn’t that determined at that point (should read “too lazy to do it”).</p><p>Anyway, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/07/16/review-dropzone-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett’s review</a> convinced me to give it another chance, especially that it could’ve also replaced another app I was using, <a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/yoink/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more%21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoink</a>. I had an idea of an action that I could develop with the Ruby API that <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropzone</a> comes with. So I got an upgrade to my version 2 license and fired it up.</p><p>For a while I used it purely as a <a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/yoink/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more/Yoink_-_Draggings_a_drag_no_more%21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoink</a> replacement and with some often used folders on the grid.</p><h2 id="and_action" tabindex="-1">And action!</h2><a class="direct-link" href="#and_action"><span class="visually-hidden">Permalink to “And action!”</span> <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a><p>Because I upload all the images I put on this blog on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rackspace Cloud Files</a>, it made sense to make an action for that. It would make things so much simpler! Just drag, drop and CDN URLs of the files are copied to clipboard!</p><p>It took a couple of weeks to get myself motivated to start it, especially because I never actually used Ruby to do anything concrete. But in the end was quite easy and fun!</p><p>After a couple of iterations I managed to get the action in a good shape with the help of <a href="https://aptonic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John from Aptonic</a> who was very quick to provide feedback. So there it is, go grab it from the <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/actions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actions page</a> and let me know your feedback!</p>
