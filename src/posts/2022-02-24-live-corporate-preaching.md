> Why isn't it malpractice for someone to call a Zoom meeting and talk at other in real time? What an astonishing waste. It's like watching someone type a book. It's like watching someone record a podcast. If you've got something to say to your team, record it. Put it on Vimeo, put it on YouTube. Instruct the people, because you have power and authority to watch it. Let them watch it sped up. Let them watch it twice. Let them watch when it works for their schedule. Let them watch it and discuss it with others. But why are we wasting the juicy magic of synchronized, real time experience so that you can be uncomfortable live in front of a bunch of people who are uncomfortable watching you pontificate? It doesn't make any sense at all. Why is it for a class room that's running on Zoom, to involve a teacher lecturing to the class for forty minutes, this makes absolutely no sense. Find one teacher, someone who's really good at it, and have them record the best forty minute lecture ever recorded, on the origins of the war of 1812, and then let everybody else watch it when they want it. The beauty of a Zoom call is not that it gives one person a chance to talk for a long time, because they have power. The beauty of it is, if we're going to do it in real time, let's make it a conversation. Let's have something going on that unfolds in a way that we cannot predict. Because if it's a memo, send a memo. Don't have the meeting. It's too expensive. It enervates us, it wipes out. We have wasted this chunk of time forcing things that should happen asynchronously into real time, just because it's convenient, just because it's become the standard. We have to stop.

From the **Akimbo** podcast, *Dancing with time* (link to episode on [Snipd](https://share.snipd.com/episode/e4867e6b-80a5-414a-9f50-6c790ff776db))

Live lectures from company leaders don't make much sense for me, other than for entertainment reasons. There might be the reasoning for having questions answered, but at the same time, in the world of Slack, that doesn't hold anymore.
